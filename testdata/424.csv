"181","Sec. 214.2","Special requirements for admission, extension, and maintenance of status.","<p style=""font-weight:bold;"">Sec. 214.2: Special requirements for admission, extension, and maintenance of status.</p><p>The general requirements in &sect; 214.1 are modified for the following nonimmigrant classes:</p><p>(a) <em>Foreign government officials</em>&mdash;(1) <em>General.</em> The determination by a consular officer prior to admission and the recognition by the Secretary of State subsequent to admission is evidence of the proper classification of a nonimmigrant under section 101(a)(15)(A) of the Act. An alien who has a nonimmigrant status under section 101(a)(15)(A)(i) or (ii) of the Act is to be admitted for the duration of the period for which the alien continues to be recognized by the Secretary of State as being entitled to that status. An alien defined in section (101)(a)(15)(A)(iii) of the Act is to be admitted for an initial period of not more than three years, and may be granted extensions of temporary stay in increments of not more than two years. In addition, the application for extension of temporary stay must be accompanied by a statement signed by the employing official stating that he/she intends to continue to employ the applicant and describing the type of work the applicant will perform.</p><p>(2) <em>Definition of A-1 or A-2 dependent.</em> For purposes of employment in the United States, the term <em>dependent</em> of an A-1 or A-2 principal alien, as used in &sect; 214.2(a), means any of the following immediate members of the family habitually residing in the same household as the principal alien who is an officer or employee assigned to a diplomatic or consular office in the United States:</p><p>(i) Spouse;</p><p>(ii) Unmarried children under the age of 21;</p><p>(iii) Unmarried sons or daughters under the age of 23 who are in full-time attendance as students at post-secondary educational institutions;</p><p>(iv) Unmarried sons or daughters under the age of 25 who are in full-time attendance as students at post-secondary educational institutions if a formal bilateral employment agreement permitting their employment in the United States was signed prior to November 21, 1988, and such bilateral employment agreement does not specify 23 as the maximum age for employment of such sons and daughters. The Office of Protocol of the Department of State shall maintain a listing of foreign states with which the United States has such bilateral employment agreements;</p><p>(v) Unmarried sons or daughters who are physically or mentally disabled to the extent that they cannot adequately care for themselves or cannot establish, maintain or re-establish their own households. The Department of State or the Service may require certification(s) as it deems sufficient to document such mental or physical disability.</p><p>(3) <em>Applicability of a formal bilateral agreement or an informal de facto arrangement for A-1 or A-2 dependents.</em> The applicability of a formal bilateral agreement shall be based on the foreign state which employs the principal alien and not on the nationality of the principal alien or dependent. The applicability of an informal de facto arrangement shall be based on the foreign state which employs the principal alien, but under a de facto arrangement the principal alien also must be a national of the foreign state which employs him/her in the United States.</p><p>(4) <em>Income tax, Social Security liability; non-applicability of certain immunities.</em> Dependents who are granted employment authorization under this section are responsible for payment of all federal, state and local income, employment and related taxes and Social Security contributions on any remuneration received. In addition, immunity from civil or administrative jurisdiction in accordance with Article 37 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations or other international agreements does not apply to these dependents with respect to matters arising out of their employment.</p><p>(5) <em>Dependent employment pursuant to formal bilateral employment agreements and informal de facto reciprocal arrangements.</em> (i) The Office of Protocol shall maintain a listing of foreign states which have entered into formal bilateral employment agreements. Dependents of an A-1 or A-2 principal alien assigned to official duty in the United States may accept or continue in unrestricted employment based on such formal bilateral agreements upon favorable recommendation by the Department of State and issuance of employment authorization documentation by the Service in accordance with 8 CFR part 274a. The application procedures are set forth in paragraph (a)(6) of this section.</p><p>(ii) For purposes of this section, an informal de facto reciprocal arrangement exists when the Department of State determines that a foreign state allows appropriate employment on the local economy for dependents of certain United States officials assigned to duty in that foreign state. The Office of Protocol shall maintain a listing of countries with which such reciprocity exists. Dependents of an A-1 or A-2 principal alien assigned to official duty in the United States may be authorized to accept or continue in employment based upon informal de facto arrangements upon favorable recommendation by the Department of State and issuance of employment authorization by the Service in accordance with 8 CFR part 274a. Additionally, the procedures set forth in paragraph (a)(6) of this section must be complied with, and the following conditions must be met:</p><p>(A) Both the principal alien and the dependent desiring employment are maintaining A-1 or A-2 status as appropriate;</p><p>(B) The principal's assignment in the United States is expected to last more than six months;</p><p>(C) Employment of a similar nature for dependents of United States Government officials assigned to official duty in the foreign state employing the principal alien is not prohibited by that foreign state's government;</p><p>(D) The proposed employment is not in an occupation listed in the Department of Labor Schedule B (20 CFR part 656), or otherwise determined by the Department of Labor to be one for which there is an oversupply of qualified U.S. workers in the area of proposed employment. This Schedule B restriction does not apply to a dependent son or daughter who is a full-time student if the employment is part-time, consisting of not more than 20 hours per week, and/or if it is temporary employment of not more than 12 weeks during school holiday periods; and</p><p>(E) The proposed employment is not contrary to the interest of the United States. Employment contrary to the interest of the United States includes, but is not limited to, the employment of A-1 or A-2 dependents: who have criminal records; who have violated United States immigration laws or regulations, or visa laws or regulations; who have worked illegally in the United States; and/or who cannot establish that they have paid taxes and social security on income from current or previous United States employment.</p><p>(6) <em>Application procedures.</em> The following procedures are applicable to dependent employment applications under bilateral agreements and de facto arrangements:</p><p>(i) The dependent must submit a completed Form I-566 to the Department of State through the office, mission, or organization which employs his/her principal alien. A dependent applying under paragraph (a)(2)(iii) or (iv) of this section must submit a certified statement from the post-secondary educational institution confirming that he/she is pursuing studies on a full-time basis. A dependent applying under paragraph (a)(2)(v) of this section must submit medical certification regarding his/her condition. The certification should identify the dependent and the certifying physician and give the physician's phone number; identify the condition, describe the symptoms and provide a prognosis; and certify that the dependent is unable to maintain a home of his or her own. Additionally, a dependent applying under the terms of a de facto arrangement must attach a statement from the prospective employer which includes the dependent's name; a description of the position offered and the duties to be performed; the salary offered; and verification that the dependent possesses the qualifications for the position.</p><p>(ii) The Department of State reviews and verifies the information provided, makes its determination, and endorses the Form I-566.</p><p>(iii) If the Department of State's endorsement is favorable, the dependent may apply to the Service. A dependent whose principal alien is stationed at a post in Washington, DC, or New York City shall apply to the District Director, Washington, DC, or New York City, respectively. A dependent whose principal alien is stationed elsewhere shall apply to the District Director, Washington, DC, unless the Service, through the Department of State, directs the dependent to apply to the district director having jurisdiction over his or her place of residence. Directors of the regional service centers may have concurrent adjudicative authority for applications filed within their respective regions. When applying to the Service, the dependent must present his or her Form I-566 with a favorable endorsement from the Department of State and any additional documentation as may be required by the Attorney General.            </p><p>(7) <em>Period of time for which employment may be authorized.</em> If approved, an application to accept or continue employment under this section shall be granted in increments of not more than three years each.</p><p>(8) <em>No appeal.</em> There shall be no appeal from a denial of permission to accept or continue employment under this section.</p><p>(9) <em>Dependents or family members of principal aliens classified A-3.</em> A dependent or family member of a principal alien classified A-3 may not be employed in the United States under this section.</p><p>(10) <em>Unauthorized employment.</em> An alien classified under section 101(a)(15)(A) of the Act who is not a principal alien and who engages in employment outside the scope of, or in a manner contrary to this section, may be considered in violation of section 241(a)(1)(C)(i) of the Act. An alien who is classified under section 101(a)(15)(A) of the Act who is a principal alien and who engages in employment outside the scope of his/her official position may be considered in violation of section 241(a)(1)(C)(i) of the Act.</p><p>(b) <em>Visitors</em>&mdash;(1) <em>General.</em> Any B-1 visitor for business or B-2 visitor for pleasure may be admitted for not more than one year and may be granted extensions of temporary stay in increments of not more than six months each, except that alien members of a religious denomination coming temporarily and solely to do missionary work in behalf of a religious denomination may be granted extensions of not more than one year each, provided that such work does not involve the selling of articles or the solicitation or acceptance of donations. Those B-1 and B-2 visitors admitted pursuant to the waiver provided at &sect; 212.1(e) of this chapter may be admitted to and stay on Guam for period not to exceed fifteen days and are not eligible for extensions of stay.</p><p>(2) <em>Minimum six month admissions.</em> Any B-2 visitor who is found otherwise admissible and is issued a Form I-94, will be admitted for a minimum period of six months, regardless of whether less time is requested, provided, that any required passport is valid as specified in section 212(a)(26) of the Act. Exceptions to the minimum six month admission may be made only in individual cases upon the specific approval of the district director for good cause.</p><p>(3) <em>Visa Waiver Pilot Program.</em> Special requirements for admission and maintenance of status for visitors admitted to the United States under the Visa Waiver Pilot Program are set forth in section 217 of the Act and part 217 of this chapter.</p><p>(4) <em>Admission of aliens pursuant to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).</em> A citizen of Canada or Mexico seeking temporary entry for purposes set forth in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section, who otherwise meets existing requirements under section 101(a)(15)(B) of the Act, including but not limited to requirements regarding the source of remuneration, shall be admitted upon presentation of proof of such citizenship in the case of Canadian applicants, and valid, unexpired entry documents such as a passport and visa, or a passport and BCC in the case of Mexican applicants, a description of the purpose for which the alien is seeking admission, and evidence demonstrating that he or she is engaged in one of the occupations or professions set forth in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section. Existing requirements, with respect to Canada, are those requirements which were in effect at the time of entry into force of the Canada/U.S. Free Trade Agreement and, with respect to Mexico, are those requirements which were in effect at the time of entry into force of the NAFTA. Additionally, nothing shall preclude the admission of a citizen of Mexico or Canada who meets the requirements of paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section.</p><p>(i) <em>Occupations and professions set forth in Appendix 1603.A.1 to Annex 1603 of the NAFTA</em>&mdash;(A) <em>Research and design.</em> Technical scientific and statistical researchers conducting independent research or research for an enterprise located in the territory of another Party.</p><p>(B) <em>Growth, manufacture and production</em> (<em>1</em>) Harvester owner supervising a harvesting crew admitted under applicable law.

Nothing in this paragraph shall preclude a business person engaged in an occupation or profession other than those listed in Appendix 1603.A.1 to Annex 1603 of the NAFTA from temporary entry under section 101(a)(15)(B) of the Act, if such person otherwise meets the existing requirements for admission as prescribed by the Attorney General.</p><p>(5) <em>Construction workers not admissible.</em> Aliens seeking to enter the country to perform building or construction work, whether on-site or in-plant, are not eligible for classification or admission as B-1 nonimmigrants under section 101(a)(15)(B) of the Act. However, alien nonimmigrants otherwise qualified as B-1 nonimmigrants may be issued visas and may enter for the purpose of supervision or training of others engaged in building or construction work, but not for the purpose of actually performing any such building or construction work themselves.</p><p>(6) [Reserved]</p><p>(7) <em>Enrollment in a course of study prohibited.</em> An alien who is admitted as, or changes status to, a B-1 or B-2 nonimmigrant on or after April 12, 2002, or who files a request to extend the period of authorized stay in B-1 or B-2 nonimmigrant status on or after such date, violates the conditions of his or her B-1 or B-2 status if the alien enrolls in a course of study. Such an alien who desires to enroll in a course of study must either obtain an F-1 or M-1 nonimmigrant visa from a consular officer abroad and seek readmission to the United States, or apply for and obtain a change of status under section 248 of the Act and 8 CFR part 248.

An alien in this status may be employed only in a crewman capacity on the vessel or aircraft of arrival, or on a vessel or aircraft of the same transportation company, and may not be employed in connection with domestic flights or movements of a vessel or aircraft. However, nonimmigrant crewmen may perform crewmember duties through stopovers on an international flight for any United States carrier where such flight uses a single aircraft and has an origination or destination point outside the United States.</p><p>(2) <em>Denial of crewman status in the case of certain labor disputes (D nonimmigrants).</em> (i) An alien shall be denied D crewman status as described in section 101(a)(15)(D) of the Act if:</p><p>(A) The alien intends to land for the purpose of performing service on a vessel of the United States (as defined in 46 U.S.C. 2101(46)) or an aircraft of an air carrier (as defined in section 101(3) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958); and            </p><p>(B) A labor dispute consisting of a strike or lockout exists in the bargaining unit of the employer in which the alien intends to perform such service; and</p><p>(C) The alien is not already an employee of the company (as described in paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of this section).</p><p>(ii) <em>Refusal to land.</em> Any alien (except a qualified current employee as described in paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of this section) who the examining immigration officer determines has arrived in the United States for the purpose of performing service on board a vessel or an aircraft of the United States when a strike or lockout is under way in the bargaining unit of the employer, shall be refused a conditional landing permit under section 252 of the Act.</p><p>(iii) <em>Ineligibility for parole.</em> An alien described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section may not be paroled into the United States under section 212(d)(5) of the Act for the purpose of performing crewmember duties unless the Attorney General determines that the parole of such alien is necessary to protect the national security of the United States. This paragraph does not prohibit the granting of parole for other purposes, such as medical emergencies.</p><p>(iv) <em>Qualified current employees.</em> (A) Paragraphs (d)(2)(i), (d)(2)(ii), and (d)(2)(iii) of this section do not apply to an alien who is already an employee of the owner or operator of the vessel or air carrier and who at the time of inspection presents true copies of employer work records which satisfy the examining immigration officer that the alien:</p><p>(<em>1</em>) Has been an employee of such employer for a period of not less than one year preceding the date that a strike or lawful lockout commenced;</p><p>(<em>2</em>) Has served as a qualified crewman for such employer at least once in three different months during the 12-month period preceding the date that the strike or lockout commenced; and</p><p>(<em>3</em>) Shall continue to provide the same crewman services that he or she previously provided to the employer.</p><p>(B) An alien crewman who qualifies as a current employee under this paragraph remains subject to the restrictions on his or her employment in the United States contained in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</p><p>(v) <em>Strike or lockout determination.</em> These provisions will take effect if the Attorney General, through the Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service or his or her designee, after consultation with the National Mediation Board, determines that a strike, lockout, or labor dispute involving a work stoppage is in progress in the bargaining unit of the employer for whom the alien intends to perform such service.</p><p>(e) <em>Treaty traders and investors</em>&mdash;(1) <em>Treaty trader.</em> An alien, if otherwise admissible, may be classified as a nonimmigrant treaty trader (E-1) under the provisions of section 101(a)(15)(E)(i) of the Act if the alien:</p><p>(i) Will be in the United States solely to carry on trade of a substantial nature, which is international in scope, either on the alien's behalf or as an employee of a foreign person or organization engaged in trade principally between the United States and the treaty country of which the alien is a national, taking into consideration any conditions in the country of which the alien is a national which may affect the alien's ability to carry on such substantial trade; and</p><p>(ii) Intends to depart the United States upon the expiration or termination of treaty trader (E-1) status.</p><p>(2) <em>Treaty investor.</em> An alien, if otherwise admissible, may be classified as a nonimmigrant treaty investor (E-2) under the provision of section 101(a)(15)(E)(ii) of the Act if the alien:</p><p>(i) Has invested or is actively in the process of investing a substantial amount of capital in a bona fide enterprise in the United States, as distinct from a relatively small amount of capital in a marginal enterprise solely for the purpose of earning a living;</p><p>(ii) Is seeking entry solely to develop and direct the enterprise; and</p><p>(iii) Intends to depart the United States upon the expiration or termination of treaty investor (E-2) status.</p><p>(3) <em>Employee of treaty trader or treaty investor.</em> An alien employee of a treaty trader, if otherwise admissible, may be classified as E-1, and an alien employee of a treaty investor, if otherwise admissible, may be classified as E-2 if the employee is in or is coming to the United States to engage in duties of an executive or supervisory character, or, if employed in a lesser capacity, the employee has special qualifications that make the alien's services essential to the efficient operation of the enterprise. The employee must have the same nationality as the principal alien employer. In addition, the employee must intend to depart the United States upon the expiration or termination of E-1 or E-2 status. The principal alien employer must be:</p><p>(i) A person in the United States having the nationality of the treaty country and maintaining nonimmigrant treaty trader or treaty investor status or, if not in the United States, would be classifiable as a treaty trader or treaty investor; or</p><p>(ii) An enterprise or organization at least 50 percent owned by persons in the United States having the nationality of the treaty country and maintaining nonimmigrant treaty trader or treaty investor status or who, if not in the United States, would be classifiable as treaty traders or treaty investors.</p><p>(4) <em>Spouse and children of treaty trader or treaty investor.</em> The spouse and child of a treaty trader or treaty investor accompanying or following to join the principal alien, if otherwise admissible, may receive the same classification as the principal alien. The nationality of a spouse or child of a treaty trader or treaty investor is not material to the classification of the spouse or child under the provisions of section 101(a)(15)(E) of the Act.</p><p>(5) <em>Nonimmigrant intent.</em> An alien classified under section 101(a)(15)(E) of the Act shall maintain an intention to depart the United States upon the expiration or termination of E-1 or E-2 status. However, an application for initial admission, change of status, or extension of stay in E classification may not be denied solely on the basis of an approved request for permanent labor certification or a filed or approved immigrant visa preference petition.</p><p>(6) <em>Treaty country.</em> A treaty country is, for purposes of this section, a foreign state with which a qualifying Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, or Navigation or its equivalent exists with the United States. A treaty country includes a foreign state that is accorded treaty visa privileges under section 101(a)(15)(E) of the Act by specific legislation.</p><p>(7) <em>Treaty country nationality.</em> The nationality of an individual treaty trader or treaty investor is determined by the authorities of the foreign state of which the alien is a national. In the case of an enterprise or organization, ownership must be traced as best as is practicable to the individuals who are ultimately its owners.</p><p>(8) <em>Terms and conditions of E treaty status</em>&mdash;(i) <em>Limitations on employment.</em> The Service determines the terms and conditions of E treaty status at the time of admission or approval of a request to change nonimmigrant status to E classification. A treaty trader, treaty investor, or treaty employee may engage only in employment which is consistent with the terms and conditions of his or her status and the activity forming the basis for the E treaty status.</p><p>(ii) <em>Subsidiary employment.</em> Treaty employees may perform work for the parent treaty organization or enterprise, or any subsidiary of the parent organization or enterprise. Performing work for subsidiaries of a common parent enterprise or organization will not be deemed to constitute a substantive change in the terms and conditions of the underlying E treaty employment if, at the time the E treaty status was determined, the applicant presented evidence establishing:</p><p>(A) The enterprise or organization, and any subsidiaries thereof, where the work will be performed; the requisite parent-subsidiary relationship; and that the subsidiary independently qualifies as a treaty organization or enterprise under this paragraph;</p><p>(B) In the case of an employee of a treaty trader or treaty investor, the work to be performed requires executive, supervisory, or essential skills; and</p><p>(C) The work is consistent with the terms and conditions of the activity forming the basis of the classification.</p><p>(iii) <em>Substantive changes.</em> Prior Service approval must be obtained where there will be a substantive change in the terms or conditions of E status. In such cases, a treaty alien must file a new application on Form I-129 and E supplement, in accordance with the instructions on that form, requesting extension of stay in the United States. In support of an alien's Form I-129 application, the treaty alien must submit evidence of continued eligibility for E classification in the new capacity. Alternatively, the alien must obtain from a consular officer a visa reflecting the new terms and conditions and subsequently apply for admission at a port-of-entry. The Service will deem there to have been a substantive change necessitating the filing of a new Form I-129 application in cases where there has been a fundamental change in the employing entity's basic characteristics, such as a merger, acquisition, or sale of the division where the alien is employed.</p><p>(iv) <em>Non-substantive changes.</em> Prior approval is not required, and there is no need to file a new Form I-129, if there is no substantive, or fundamental, change in the terms or conditions of the alien's employment which would affect the alien's eligibility for E classification. Further, prior approval is not required if corporate changes occur which do not affect the previously approved employment relationship, or are otherwise non-substantive. To facilitate admission, the alien may:</p><p>(A) Present a letter from the treaty-qualifying company through which the alien attained E classification explaining the nature of the change;</p><p>(B) Request a new Form I-797, Approval Notice, reflecting the non-substantive change by filing with the appropriate Service Center Form I-129, with fee, and a complete description of the change, or;</p><p>(C) Apply directly to State for a new E visa reflecting the change. An alien who does not elect one of the three options contained in paragraph (e)(8)(iv) (A) through (C) of this section, is not precluded from demonstrating to the satisfaction of the immigration officer at the port-of-entry in some other manner, his or her admissibility under section 101(a)(15)(E) of the Act.</p><p>(v) <em>Advice.</em> To ascertain whether a change is substantive, an alien may file with the Service Center Form I-129, with fee, and a complete description of the change, to request appropriate advice. In cases involving multiple employees, an alien may request that a Service Center determine if a merger or other corporate restructuring requires the filing of separate applications by filing a single Form I-129, with fee, and attaching a list of the related receipt numbers for the employees involved and an explanation of the change or changes. Where employees are located within multiple jurisdictions, such a request for advice must be filed with the Service Center in Lincoln, Nebraska.</p><p>(vi) <em>Approval.</em> If an application to change the terms and conditions of E status or employment is approved, the Service shall notify the applicant on Form I-797. An extension of stay in nonimmigrant E classification may be granted for the validity of the approved application. The alien is not authorized to begin the new employment until the application is approved. Employment is authorized only for the period of time the alien remains in the United States. If the alien subsequently departs from the United States, readmission in E classification may be authorized where the alien presents his or her unexpired E visa together with the Form I-797, Approval Notice, indicating Service approval of a change of employer or of a change in the substantive terms or conditions of treaty status or employment in E classification, or, in accordance with 22 CFR 41.112(d), where the alien is applying for readmission after an absence not exceeding 30 days solely in contiguous territory.</p><p>(vii) An unauthorized change of employment to a new employer will constitute a failure to maintain status within the meaning of section 237(a)(1)(C)(i) of the Act. In all cases where the treaty employee will be providing services to a subsidiary under this paragraph, the subsidiary is required to comply with the terms of 8 CFR part 274a.</p><p>(9) <em>Trade&mdash;definitions.</em> For purposes of this paragraph: <em>Items of trade</em> include but are not limited to goods, services, international banking, insurance, monies, transportation, communications, data processing, advertising, accounting, design and engineering, management consulting, tourism, technology and its transfer, and some news-gathering activities. For purposes of this paragraph, goods are tangible commodities or merchandise having extrinsic value. Further, as used in this paragraph, services are legitimate economic activities which provide other than tangible goods.</p><p><em>Trade</em> is the existing international exchange of items of trade for consideration between the United States and the treaty country. Existing trade includes successfully negotiated contracts binding upon the parties which call for the immediate exchange of items of trade. Domestic trade or the development of domestic markets without international exchange does not constitute trade for purposes of section 101(a)(15)(E) of the Act. This exchange must be traceable and identifiable. Title to the trade item must pass from one treaty party to the other.</p><p>(10) <em>Substantial trade.</em> Substantial trade is an amount of trade sufficient to ensure a continuous flow of international trade items between the United States and the treaty country. This continuous flow contemplates numerous transactions over time. Treaty trader status may not be established or maintained on the basis of a single transaction, regardless of how protracted or monetarily valuable the transaction. Although the monetary value of the trade item being exchanged is a relevant consideration, greater weight will be given to more numerous exchanges of larger value. There is no minimum requirement with respect to the monetary value or volume of each individual transaction. In the case of smaller businesses, an income derived from the value of numerous transactions which is sufficient to support the treaty trader and his or her family constitutes a favorable factor in assessing the existence of substantial trade.</p><p>(11) <em>Principal trade.</em> Principal trade between the United States and the treaty country exists when over 50 percent of the volume of international trade of the treaty trader is conducted between the United States and the treaty country of the treaty trader's nationality.</p><p>(12) <em>Investment.</em> An investment is the treaty investor's placing of capital, including funds and other assets (which have not been obtained, directly or indirectly, through criminal activity), at risk in the commercial sense with the objective of generating a profit. The treaty investor must be in possession of and have control over the capital invested or being invested. The capital must be subject to partial or total loss if investment fortunes reverse. Such investment capital must be the investor's unsecured personal business capital or capital secured by personal assets. Capital in the process of being invested or that has been invested must be irrevocably committed to the enterprise. The alien has the burden of establishing such irrevocable commitment. The alien may use any legal mechanism available, such as the placement of invested funds in escrow pending admission in, or approval of, E classification, that would not only irrevocably commit funds to the enterprise, but might also extend personal liability protection to the treaty investor in the event the application for E classification is denied.</p><p>(13) <em>Bona fide enterprise.</em> The enterprise must be a real, active, and operating commercial or entrepreneurial undertaking which produces services or goods for profit. The enterprise must meet applicable legal requirements for doing business in the particular jurisdiction in the United States.</p><p>(14) <em>Substantial amount of capital.</em> A substantial amount of capital constitutes an amount which is:</p><p>(i) Substantial in relationship to the total cost of either purchasing an established enterprise or creating the type of enterprise under consideration;</p><p>(ii) Sufficient to ensure the treaty investor's financial commitment to the successful operation of the enterprise; and</p><p>(iii) Of a magnitude to support the likelihood that the treaty investor will successfully develop and direct the enterprise. Generally, the lower the cost of the enterprise, the higher, proportionately, the investment must be to be considered a substantial amount of capital.</p><p>(15) <em>Marginal enterprise.</em> For purposes of this section, an enterprise may not be marginal. A marginal enterprise is an enterprise that does not have the present or future capacity to generate more than enough income to provide a minimal living for the treaty investor and his or her family. An enterprise that does not have the capacity to generate such income, but that has a present or future capacity to make a significant economic contribution is not a marginal enterprise. The projected future income-generating capacity should generally be realizable within 5 years from the date the alien commences the normal business activity of the enterprise.</p><p>(16) <em>Solely to develop and direct.</em> An alien seeking classification as a treaty investor (or, in the case of an employee of a treaty investor, the owner of the treaty enterprise) must demonstrate that he or she does or will develop and direct the investment enterprise. Such an applicant must establish that he or she controls the enterprise by demonstrating ownership of at least 50 percent of the enterprise, by possessing operational control through a managerial position or other corporate device, or by other means.</p><p>(17) <em>Executive and supervisory character.</em> The applicant's position must be principally and primarily, as opposed to incidentally or collaterally, executive or supervisory in nature. Executive and supervisory duties are those which provide the employee ultimate control and responsibility for the enterprise's overall operation or a major component thereof. In determining whether the applicant has established possession of the requisite control and responsibility, a Service officer shall consider, where applicable:</p><p>(i) That an executive position is one which provides the employee with great authority to determine the policy of, and the direction for, the enterprise;</p><p>(ii) That a position primarily of supervisory character provides the employee supervisory responsibility for a significant proportion of an enterprise's operations and does not generally involve the direct supervision of low-level employees, and;</p><p>(iii) Whether the applicant possesses executive and supervisory skills and experience; a salary and position title commensurate with executive or supervisory employment; recognition or indicia of the position as one of authority and responsibility in the overall organizational structure; responsibility for making discretionary decisions, setting policies, directing and managing business operations, supervising other professional and supervisory personnel; and that, if the position requires some routine work usually performed by a staff employee, such functions may only be of an incidental nature.</p><p>(18) <em>Special qualifications.</em> Special qualifications are those skills and/or aptitudes that an employee in a lesser capacity brings to a position or role that are essential to the successful or efficient operation of the treaty enterprise. In determining whether the skills possessed by the alien are essential to the operation of the employing treaty enterprise, a Service officer must consider, where applicable:</p><p>(i) The degree of proven expertise of the alien in the area of operations involved; whether others possess the applicant's specific skill or aptitude; the length of the applicant's experience and/or training with the treaty enterprise; the period of training or other experience necessary to perform effectively the projected duties; the relationship of the skill or knowledge to the enterprise's specific processes or applications, and the salary the special qualifications can command; that knowledge of a foreign language and culture does not, by itself, meet the special qualifications requirement, and;</p><p>(ii) Whether the skills and qualifications are readily available in the United States. In all cases, in determining whether the applicant possesses special qualifications which are essential to the treaty enterprise, a Service officer must take into account all the particular facts presented. A skill that is essential at one point in time may become commonplace at a later date. Skills that are needed to start up an enterprise may no longer be essential after initial operations are complete and running smoothly. Some skills are essential only in the short-term for the training of locally hired employees. Under certain circumstances, an applicant may be able to establish his or her essentiality to the treaty enterprise for a longer period of time, such as, in connection with activities in the areas of product improvement, quality control, or the provision of a service not yet generally available in the United States. Where the treaty enterprise's need for the applicant's special qualifications, and therefore, the applicant's essentiality, is time-limited, Service officers may request that the applicant provide evidence of the period for which skills will be needed and a reasonable projected date for completion of start-up or replacement of the essential skilled workers.</p><p>(19) <em>Period of admission.</em> Periods of admission are as follows:</p><p>(i) A treaty trader or treaty investor may be admitted for an initial period of not more than 2 years.</p><p>(ii) The spouse and minor children accompanying or following to join a treaty trader or treaty investor shall be admitted for the period during which the principal alien is in valid treaty trader or investor status. The temporary departure from the United States of the principal trader or investor shall not affect the derivative status of the dependent spouse and minor unmarried children, provided the familial relationship continues to exist and the principal remains eligible for admission as an E nonimmigrant to perform the activity.</p><p>(iii) Unless otherwise provided for in this chapter, an alien shall not be admitted in E classification for a period of time extending more than 6 months beyond the expiration date of the alien's passport.</p><p>(20) <em>Extensions of stay.</em> Requests for extensions of stay may be granted in increments of not more than 2 years. A treaty trader or treaty investor in valid E status may apply for an extension of stay by filing an application for extension of stay on Form I-129 and E Supplement, with required accompanying documents, in accordance with &sect; 214.1 and the instructions on that form.</p><p>(i) For purposes of eligibility for an extension of stay, the alien must prove that he or she:</p><p>(A) Has at all times maintained the terms and conditions of his or her E nonimmigrant classification;</p><p>(B) Was physically present in the United States at the time of filing the application for extension of stay; and</p><p>(C) Has not abandoned his or her extension request.</p><p>(ii) With limited exceptions, it is presumed that employees of treaty enterprises with special qualifications who are responsible for start-up operations should be able to complete their objectives within 2 years. Absent special circumstances, therefore, such employees will not be eligible to obtain an extension of stay.</p><p>(iii) Subject to paragraph (e)(5) of this section and the presumption noted in paragraph (e)(22)(ii) of this section, there is no specified number of extensions of stay that a treaty trader or treaty investor may be granted.</p><p>(21) <em>Change of nonimigrant status.</em> (i) An alien in another valid nonimmigrant status may apply for change of status to E classification by filing an application for change of status on Form I-129 and E Supplement, with required accompanying documents establishing eligibility for a change of status and E classification, in accordance with 8 CFR part 248 and the instructions on Form I-129 and E Supplement.</p><p>(ii) The spouse or minor children of an applicant seeking a change of status to that of treaty trader or treaty investor alien shall file concurrent applications for change of status to derivative treaty classification on the appropriate Service form. Applications for derivative treaty status shall:</p><p>(A) Be approved only if the principal treaty alien is granted treaty alien status and continues to maintain that status;</p><p>(B) Be approved for the period of admission authorized in paragraph (e)(20) of this section.</p><p>(22) <em>Denial of treaty trader or treaty investor status to citizens of Canada or Mexico in the case of certain labor disputes.</em> (i) A citizen of Canada or Mexico may be denied E treaty trader or treaty investor status as described in section 101(a)(15)(E) of the Act and section B of Annex 1603 of the NAFTA if:</p><p>(A) The Secretary of Labor certifies to or otherwise informs the Commissioner that a strike or other labor dispute involving a work stoppage of workers in the alien's occupational classification is in progress at the place where the alien is or intends to be employed; and</p><p>(B) Temporary entry of that alien may affect adversely either:</p><p>(<em>1</em>) The settlement of any labor dispute that is in progress at the place or intended place of employment, or</p><p>(<em>2</em>) The employment of any person who is involved in such dispute.</p><p>(ii) If the alien has already commenced employment in the United States and is participating in a strike or other labor dispute involving a work stoppage of workers, whether or not such strike or other labor dispute has been certified by the Secretary of Labor, or whether the Service has been otherwise informed that such a strike or labor dispute is in progress, the alien shall not be deemed to be failing to maintain his or her status solely on account of past, present, or future participation in a strike or other labor dispute involving a work stoppage of workers, but is subject to the following terms and conditions:</p><p>(A) The alien shall remain subject to all applicable provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act, and regulations promulgated in the same manner as all other E nonimmigrants; and</p><p>(B) The status and authorized period of stay of such an alien is not modified or extended in any way by virtue of his or her participation in a strike or other labor dispute involving a work stoppage of workers.</p><p>(iii) Although participation by an E nonimmigrant alien in a strike or other labor dispute involving a work stoppage of workers will not constitute a ground for deportation, any alien who violates his or her status or who remains in the United States after his or her authorized period of stay has expired will be subject to deportation.</p><p>(iv) If there is a strike or other labor dispute involving a work stoppage of workers in progress, but such strike or other labor dispute is not certified under paragraph (e)(22)(i) of this section, or the Service has not otherwise been informed by the Secretary that such a strike or labor dispute is in progress, the Commissioner shall not deny entry to an applicant for E status.</p><p>(f) <em>Students in colleges, universities, seminaries, conservatories, academic high schools, elementary schools, other academic institutions, and in language training programs</em>&mdash;(1) <em>Admission of student</em>&mdash;(i) <em>Eligibility for admission.</em> A nonimmigrant student may be admitted into the United States in nonimmigrant status under section 101(a)(15)(F) of the Act, if:</p><p>(A) The student presents a SEVIS Form I-20 issued in his or her own name by a school approved by the Service for attendance by F-1 foreign students. (In the alternative, for a student seeking admission prior to August 1, 2003, the student may present a currently-valid Form I-20A-B/I-20ID, if that form was issued by the school prior to January 30, 2003);</p><p>(B) The student has documentary evidence of financial support in the amount indicated on the SEVIS Form I-20 (or the Form I-20A-B/I-20ID);</p><p>(C) For students seeking initial admission only, the student intends to attend the school specified in the student's visa (or, where the student is exempt from the requirement for a visa, the school indicated on the SEVIS Form I-20 (or the Form I-20A-B/I-20ID)); and</p><p>(D) In the case of a student who intends to study at a public secondary school, the student has demonstrated that he or she has reimbursed the local educational agency that administers the school for the full, unsubsidized per capita cost of providing education at the school for the period of the student's attendance.</p><p>(ii) <em>Disposition of Form I-20 A-B/I-20 ID.</em> Form I-20 A-B/I-20 ID contains two copies, the I-20 School Copy and the I-20 ID (Student) Copy. For purposes of clarity, the entire Form I-20 A-B/I-20 ID shall be referred to as Form I-20 A-B and the I-20 ID (Student) Copy shall be referred to as the I-20 ID. When an F-1 student applies for admission with a complete Form I-20 A-B, the inspecting officer shall:</p><p>(A) Transcribe the student's admission number from Form I-94 onto his or her Form I-20 A-B (for students seeking initial admission only);</p><p>(B) Endorse all copies of the Form I-20 A-B;            </p><p>(C) Return the I-20 ID to the student; and</p><p>(D) Forward the I-20 School Copy to the Service's processing center for data entry. (The school copy of Form I-20 A-B will be sent back to the school as a notice of the student's admission after data entry.)</p><p>(iii) <em>Use of SEVIS.</em> On January 30, 2003, the use of the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) will become mandatory for the issuance of any new Form I-20. A student or dependent who presents a non-SEVIS Form I-20 issued on or after January 30, 2003, will not be accepted for admission to the United States. Non-SEVIS Forms I-20 issued prior to January 30, 2003, will continue to be acceptable until August 1, 2003. However, schools must issue a SEVIS Form I-20 to any current student requiring a reportable action (e.g., extension of status, practical training, and requests for employment authorization) or a new Form I-20, or for any aliens who must obtain a new nonimmigrant student visa. As of August 1, 2003, the records of all current or continuing students must be entered in SEVIS.</p><p>(2) <em>I-20 ID.</em> An F-1 student is expected to safekeep the initial I-20 ID bearing the admission number and any subsequent copies which have been issued to him or her. Should the student lose his or her current I-20 ID, a replacement copy bearing the same information as the lost copy, including any endorsement for employment and notations, may be issued by the designated school official (DSO) as defined in 8 CFR 214.3(<em>l</em>)(1)(i).</p><p>(3) <em>Admission of the spouse and minor children of an F-1 student.</em> The spouse and minor children accompanying an F-1 student are eligible for admission in F-2 status if the student is admitted in F-1 status. The spouse and minor children following-to-join an F-1 student are eligible for admission to the United States in F-2 status if they are able to demonstrate that the F-1 student has been admitted and is, or will be within 30 days, enrolled in a full course of study, or engaged in approved practical training following completion of studies. In either case, at the time they seek admission, the eligible spouse and minor children of an F-1 student with a SEVIS Form I-20 must individually present an original SEVIS Form I-20 issued in the name of each F-2 dependent issued by a school authorized by the Service for attendance by F-1 foreign students. Prior to August 1, 2003, if exigent circumstances are demonstrated, the Service will allow the dependent of an F-1 student in possession of a SEVIS Form I-20 to enter the United States using a copy of the F-1 student's SEVIS Form I-20. (In the alternative, for dependents seeking admission to the United States prior to August 1, 2003, a copy of the F-1 student's current Form I-20ID issued prior to January 30, 2003, with proper endorsement by the DSO will satisfy this requirement.) A new SEVIS Form I-20 (or Form I-20A-B) is required for a dependent where there has been any substantive change in the F-1 student's current information.</p><p>(4) <em>Temporary absence.</em> An F-1 student returning to the United States from a temporary absence of five months or less may be readmitted for attendance at a Service-approved educational institution, if the student presents:</p><p>(i) A current SEVIS Form I-20 (or, for readmission prior to August 1, 2003, a current Form I-20ID which was issued prior to January 30, 2003), properly endorsed by the DSO for reentry if there has been no substantive change to the most recent Form I-20 information; or</p><p>(ii) A new SEVIS Form I-20 (or, for readmission prior to August 1, 2003, a new Form I-20ID which was issued prior to January 30, 2003), if there has been a substantive change in the information on the student's most recent Form I-20 information, such as in the case of a student who has changed the major area of study, who intends to transfer to another Service approved institution or who has advanced to a higher level of study.</p><p>(5) <em>Duration of status</em>&mdash;(i) <em>General.</em> Except for border commuter students covered by the provisions of paragraph (f)(18) of this section, an F-1 student is admitted for duration of status. Duration of status is defined as the time during which an F-1 student is pursuing a full course of study at an educational institution approved by the Service for attendance by foreign students, or engaging in authorized practical training following completion of studies, except that an F-1 student who is admitted to attend a public high school is restricted to an aggregate of 12 months of study at any public high school(s). An F-1 student may be admitted for a period up to 30 days before the indicated report date or program start date listed on Form I-20. The student is considered to be maintaining status if he or she is making normal progress toward completing a course of study.</p><p>(ii) <em>Change in educational levels.</em> An F-1 student who continues from one educational level to another is considered to be maintaining status, provided that the transition to the new educational level is accomplished according to transfer procedures outlined in paragraph (f)(8) of this section.</p><p>(iii) <em>Annual vacation.</em> An F-1 student at an academic institution is considered to be in status during the annual (or summer) vacation if the student is eligible and intends to register for the next term. A student attending a school on a quarter or trimester calendar who takes only one vacation a year during any one of the quarters or trimesters instead of during the summer is considered to be in status during that vacation, if the student has completed the equivalent of an academic year prior to taking the vacation.</p><p>(iv) <em>Preparation for departure.</em> An F-1 student who has completed a course of study and any authorized practical training following completion of studies will be allowed an additional 60-day period to prepare for departure from the United States or to transfer in accordance with paragraph (f)(8) of this section. An F-1 student authorized by the DSO to withdraw from classes will be allowed a 15-day period for departure from the United States. However, an F-1 student who fails to maintain a full course of study without the approval of the DSO or otherwise fails to maintain status is not eligible for an additional period for departure.</p><p>(v) <em>Emergent circumstances as determined by the Commissioner.</em> Where the Commissioner has suspended the applicability of any or all of the requirements for on-campus or off-campus employment authorization for specified students pursuant to paragraphs (f)(9)(i) or (f)(9)(ii) of this section by notice in the <em>Federal Register,</em> an affected student who needs to reduce his or her full course of study as a result of accepting employment authorized by such notice in the <em>Federal Register</em> will be considered to be in status during the authorized employment, subject to any other conditions specified in the notice, provided that, for the duration of the authorized employment, the student is registered for the number of semester or quarter hours of instruction per academic term specified in the notice, which in no event shall be less than 6 semester or quarter hours of instruction per academic term if the student is at the undergraduate level or less than 3 semester or quarter hours of instruction per academic term if the student is at the graduate level, and is continuing to make progress toward completing the course of study.</p><p>(vi) <em>Extension of duration of status and grant of employment authorization.</em></p><p>(A) The duration of status, and any employment authorization granted under 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(3)(i)(B) and (C), of an F-1 student who is the beneficiary of an H-1B petition and request for change of status shall be automatically extended until October 1 of the fiscal year for which such H-1B visa is being requested where such petition:</p><p>(<em>1</em>) Has been timely filed; and</p><p>(<em>2</em>) States that the employment start date for the F-1 student is October 1 of the following fiscal year.</p><p>(B) The automatic extension of an F-1 student's duration of status and employment authorization under paragraph (f)(5)(vi)(A) of this section shall immediately terminate upon the rejection, denial, or revocation of the H-1B petition filed on such F-1 student's behalf.</p><p>(C) In order to obtain the automatic extension of stay and employment authorization under paragraph (f)(5)(vi)(A) of this section, the F-1 student, according to 8 CFR part 248, must not have violated the terms or conditions of his or her nonimmigrant status.</p><p>(D) An automatic extension of an F-1 student's duration of status under paragraph (f)(5)(vi)(A) of this section also applies to the duration of status of any F-2 dependent aliens.</p><p>(6) <em>Full course of study</em>&mdash;(i) <em>General.</em> Successful completion of the full course of study must lead to the attainment of a specific educational or professional objective. A course of study at an institution not approved for attendance by foreign students as provided in &sect; 214.3(a)(3) does not satisfy this requirement. A &ldquo;full course of study&rdquo; as required by section 101(a)(15)(F)(i) of the Act means:</p><p>(A) Postgraduate study or postdoctoral study at a college or university, or undergraduate or postgraduate study at a conservatory or religious seminary, certified by a DSO as a full course of study;</p><p>(B) Undergraduate study at a college or university, certified by a school official to consist of at least twelve semester or quarter hours of instruction per academic term in those institutions using standard semester, trimester, or quarter hour systems, where all undergraduate students who are enrolled for a minimum of twelve semester or quarter hours are charged full-time tuition or are considered full-time for other administrative purposes, or its equivalent (as determined by the district director in the school approval process), except when the student needs a lesser course load to complete the course of study during the current term;</p><p>(C) Study in a postsecondary language, liberal arts, fine arts, or other non-vocational program at a school which confers upon its graduates recognized associate or other degrees or has established that its credits have been and are accepted unconditionally by at least three institutions of higher learning which are either: (1) A school (or school system) owned and operated as a public educational institution by the United States or a State or political subdivision thereof; or (2) a school accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting body; and which has been certified by a designated school official to consist of at least twelve clock hours of instruction a week, or its equivalent as determined by the district director in the school approval process;</p><p>(D) Study in any other language, liberal arts, fine arts, or other nonvocational training program, certified by a designated school official to consist of at least eighteen clock hours of attendance a week if the dominant part of the course of study consists of classroom instruction, or to consist of at least twenty-two clock hours a week if the dominant part of the course of study consists of laboratory work; or</p><p>(E) Study in a curriculum at an approved private elementary or middle school or public or private academic high school which is certified by a designated school official to consist of class attendance for not less than the minimum number of hours a week prescribed by the school for normal progress toward graduation.</p><p>(F) Notwithstanding paragraphs (f)(6)(i)(A) and (f)(6)(i)(B) of this section, an alien who has been granted employment authorization pursuant to the terms of a document issued by the Commissioner under paragraphs (f)(9)(i) or (f)(9)(ii) of this section and published in the <em>Federal Register</em> shall be deemed to be engaged in a &ldquo;full course of study&rdquo; if he or she remains registered for no less than the number of semester or quarter hours of instruction per academic term specified by the Commissioner in the notice for the validity period of such employment authorization.</p><p>(G) For F-1 students enrolled in classes for credit or classroom hours, no more than the equivalent of one class or three credits per session, term, semester, trimester, or quarter may be counted toward the full course of study requirement if the class is taken on-line or through distance education and does not require the student's physical attendance for classes, examination or other purposes integral to completion of the class. An on-line or distance education course is a course that is offered principally through the use of television, audio, or computer transmission including open broadcast, closed circuit, cable, microwave, or satellite, audio conferencing, or computer conferencing. If the F-1 student's course of study is in a language study program, no on-line or distance education classes may be considered to count toward a student's full course of study requirement.            </p><p>(H) On-campus employment pursuant to the terms of a scholarship, fellowship, or assistantship is deemed to be part of the academic program of a student otherwise taking a full course of study.</p><p>(ii) <em>Institution of higher learning.</em> For purposes of this paragraph, a college or university is an institution of higher learning which awards recognized associate, bachelor's, master's, doctorate, or professional degrees. Schools which devote themselves exclusively or primarily to vocational, business, or language instruction are not included in the category of colleges or universities. Vocational or business schools which are classifiable as M-1 schools are provided for by regulations under 8 CFR 214.2(m).</p><p>(iii) <em>Reduced course load.</em> The designated school official may allow an F-1 student to engage in less than a full course of study as provided in this paragraph (f)(6)(iii). Except as otherwise noted, a reduced course load must consist of at least six semester or quarter hours, or half the clock hours required for a full course of study. A student who drops below a full course of study without the prior approval of the DSO will be considered out of status. On-campus employment pursuant to the terms of a scholarship, fellowship, or assistantship is deemed to be part of the academic program of a student otherwise taking a full course of study.</p><p>(A) <em>Academic difficulties.</em> The DSO may authorize a reduced course load on account of a student's initial difficulty with the English language or reading requirements, unfamiliarity with U.S. teaching methods, or improper course level placement. The student must resume a full course of study at the next available term, session, or semester, excluding a summer session, in order to maintain student status. A student previously authorized to drop below a full course of study due to academic difficulties is not eligible for a second authorization by the DSO due to academic difficulties while pursuing a course of study at that program level. A student authorized to drop below a full course of study for academic difficulties while pursuing a course of study at a particular program level may still be authorized for a reduced course load due to an illness medical condition as provided for in paragraph (B) of this section.</p><p>(B) <em>Medical conditions.</em> The DSO may authorize a reduced course load (or, if necessary, no course load) due to a student's temporary illness or medical condition for a period of time not to exceed an aggregate of 12 months while the student is pursuing a course of study at a particular program level. In order to authorize a reduced course load based upon a medical condition, the student must provide medical documentation from a licensed medical doctor, doctor of osteopathy, or licensed clinical psychologist, to the DSO to substantiate the illness or medical condition. The student must provide current medical documentation and the DSO must reauthorize the drop below full course of study each new term, session, or semester. A student previously authorized to drop below a full course of study due to illness or medical condition for an aggregate of 12 months may not be authorized by a DSO to reduce his or her course load on subsequent occasions while pursuing a course of study at the same program level. A student may be authorized to reduce course load for a reason of illness or medical condition on more than one occasion while pursuing a course of study, so long as the aggregate period of that authorization does not exceed 12 months.</p><p>(C) <em>Completion of course of study.</em> The DSO may authorize a reduced course load in the student's final term, semester, or session if fewer courses are needed to complete the course of study. If the student is not required to take any additional courses to satisfy the requirements for completion, but continues to be enrolled for administrative purposes, the student is considered to have completed the course of study and must take action to maintain status. Such action may include application for change of status or departure from the U.S.</p><p>(D) <em>Reporting requirements for non-SEVIS schools.</em> A DSO must report to the Service any student who is authorized to reduce his or her course load. Within 21 days of the authorization, the DSO must send a photocopy of the student's current Form I-20ID along with Form I-538 to Service's data processing center indicating the date and reason that the student was authorized to drop below full time status. Similarly, the DSO will report to the Service no more than 21 days after the student has resumed a full course of study by submitting a current copy of the students' Form I-20ID to the Service's data processing center indicating the date a full course of study was resumed and the new program end date with Form I-538, if applicable.</p><p>(E) S<em>EVIS reporting requirements.</em> In order for a student to be authorized to drop below a full course of study, the DSO must update SEVIS prior to the student reducing his or her course load. The DSO must update SEVIS with the date, reason for authorization, and the start date of the next term or session. The DSO must also notify SEVIS within 21 days of the student's commencement of a full course of study. If an extension of the program end date is required due to the drop below a full course of study, the DSO must update SEVIS by completing a new SEVIS Form I-20 with the new program end date in accordance with paragraph (f)(7) of this section.</p><p>(iv) <em>Concurrent enrollment.</em> An F-1 student may be enrolled in two different Service-approved schools at one time as long as the combined enrollment amounts to a full time course of study. In cases where a student is concurrently enrolled, the school from which the student will earn his or her degree or certification should issue the Form I-20, and conduct subsequent certifications and updates to the Form I-20. The DSO from this school is also responsible for all of the reporting requirements to the Service. In instances where a student is enrolled in programs with different full course of study requirements (e.g., clock hours vs. credit hours), the DSO is permitted to determine what constitutes a full time course of study.</p><p>(7) <em>Extension of stay</em>&mdash;(i) <em>General.</em> An F-1 student who is admitted for duration of status is not required to apply for extension of stay as long as the student is maintaining status and making normal progress toward completion of his or her educational objective. An F-1 student who is currently maintaining status and making normal progress toward completing his or her educational objective, but who is unable to complete his or her course of study by the program end date on the Form I-20, must apply prior to the program end date for a program extension pursuant to paragraph (f)(7)(iii) of this section.</p><p>(ii) <em>Report date and program completion date on Form I-20.</em> When determining the report date on the Form I-20, the DSO may choose a reasonable date to accommodate a student's need to be in attendance for required activities at the school prior to the actual start of classes. Such required activities may include, but are not limited to, research projects and orientation sessions. However, for purposes of employment, the DSO may not indicate a report date more than 30 days prior to the start of classes. When determining the program completion date on Form I-20, the DSO should make a reasonable estimate based upon the time an average student would need to complete a similar program in the same discipline.</p><p>(iii) <em>Program extension for students in lawful status.</em> An F-1 student who is unable to meet the program completion date on the Form I-20 may be granted an extension by the DSO if the DSO certifies that the student has continually maintained status and that the delays are caused by compelling academic or medical reasons, such as changes of major or research topics, unexpected research problems, or documented illnesses. Delays caused by academic probation or suspension are not acceptable reasons for program extensions. A DSO may not grant an extension if the student did not apply for an extension until after the program end date noted on the Form I-20. An F-1 student who is unable to complete the educational program within the time listed on Form I-20 and who is ineligible for program extension pursuant to this paragraph (f)(7) is considered out of status. If eligible, the student may apply for reinstatement under the provisions of paragraph (f)(16) of this section.</p><p>(iv) <em>Notification.</em> Upon granting a program extension, a DSO at a non-SEVIS school must immediately submit notification to the Service's data processing center using Form I-538 and the top page of Form I-20A-B showing the new program completion date. For a school enrolled in SEVIS, a DSO may grant a program extension only by updating SEVIS and issuing a new Form I-20 reflecting the current program end date. A DSO may grant an extension any time prior to the program end date listed on the student's original Form I-20.</p><p>(8) <em>School transfer.</em>(i) A student who is maintaining status may transfer to another Service approved school by following the notification procedure prescribed in paragraph (f)(8)(ii) of this section. However, an F-1 student is not permitted to remain in the United States when transferring between schools or programs unless the student will begin classes at the transfer school or program within 5 months of transferring out of the current school or within 5 months of the program completion date on his or her current Form I-20, whichever is earlier. In the case of an F-1 student authorized to engage in post-completion optional practical training (OPT), the student must be able resume classes within 5 months of transferring out of the school that recommended OPT or the date the OPT authorization ends, whichever is earlier. An F-1 student who was not pursuing a full course of study at the school he or she was last authorized to attend is ineligible for school transfer and must apply for reinstatement under the provisions of paragraph (f)(16) of this section, or, in the alternative, may depart the country and return as an initial entry in a new F-1 nonimmigrant status.</p><p>(ii) <em>Transfer procedure.</em> To transfer schools, an F-1 student must first notify the school he or she is attending of the intent to transfer, then obtain a Form I-20 A-B, issued in accordance with the provisions of 8 CFR 214.3(k), from the school to which he or she intends to transfer. The transfer will be effected only if the F-1 student completes the Student Certification portion of the Form I-20 A-B and returns the form to a designated school official on campus within 15 days of beginning attendance at the new school.</p><p>(A) <em>Non-SEVIS School to Non-SEVIS school.</em> To transfer from one non-SEVIS school to a different non-SEVIS school, the student must first notify the school he or she is attending of the intent to transfer, then obtain a Form I-20 issued in accordance with the provisions of 8 CFR 214.3(k) from the school to which he or she intends to transfer. Prior to issuance of any Form I-20, the DSO at the transfer school is responsible for determining that the student has been maintaining status at his or her current school and is eligible for transfer to the new school. The transfer will be effected only if the student completes the Student Certification portion of the Form I-20 and returns the form to a DSO of the transfer school within 15 days of the program start date listed on Form I-20. Upon receipt of the student's Form I-20 the DSO must note &ldquo;transfer completed on (date)&rdquo; in the space provided for the DSO's remarks, thereby acknowledging the student's attendance at the transfer school; return the Form I-20 to the student; submit the School copy of the Form I-20 to Service's Data Processing Center within 30 days of receipt from the student; and forward a photocopy of the school copy to the school from which the student transferred.</p><p>(B) <em>Non-SEVIS school to SEVIS school.</em> To transfer from a non-SEVIS school to a SEVIS school, the student must first notify the school he or she is attending of the intent to transfer, then obtain a SEVIS Form I-20 issued in accordance with the provisions of 8 CFR 214.3(k) from the school to which he or she intends to transfer. Prior to issuance of any Form I-20, the DSO at the transfer school is responsible for determining that the student has been maintaining status at his or her current school and is eligible for transfer to the new school. Once the transfer school has issued the SEVIS Form I-20 to the student indicating a transfer, the transfer school becomes responsible for updating and maintaining the student's record in SEVIS. The student is then required to notify the DSO at the transfer school within 15 days of the program start date listed on SEVIS Form I-20. Upon notification that the student is enrolled in classes, the DSO of the transfer school must update SEVIS to reflect the student's registration and current address, thereby acknowledging that the student has completed the transfer process. In the remarks section of the student's SEVIS Form I-20, the DSO must note that the transfer has been completed, including the date, and return the form to the student. The transfer is effected when the transfer school updates SEVIS indicating that the student has registered in classes within the 30 days required by &sect; 214.3(g)(3)(iii).</p><p>(C) <em>SEVIS school to SEVIS school.</em> To transfer from a SEVIS school to a SEVIS school the student must first notify his or her current school of the intent to transfer and must indicate the school to which he or she intends to transfer. Upon notification by the student, the current school will update the student's record in SEVIS as a &ldquo;transfer out&rdquo; and indicate the school to which the student intends to transfer, and a release date. The release date will be the current semester or session completion date, or the date of expected transfer if earlier than the established academic cycle. The current school will retain control over the student's record in SEVIS until the student completes the current term or reaches the release date. At the request of the student, the DSO of the current school may cancel the transfer request at any time prior to the release date. As of the release date specified by the current DSO, the transfer school will be granted full access to the student's SEVIS record and then becomes responsible for that student. The current school conveys authority and responsibility over that student to the transfer school, and will no longer have full SEVIS access to that student's record. As such, a transfer request may not be cancelled by the current DSO after the release date has been reached. After the release date, the transfer DSO must complete the transfer of the student's record in SEVIS and may issue a SEVIS Form I-20. The student is then required to contact the DSO at the transfer school within 15 days of the program start date listed on the SEVIS Form I-20. Upon notification that the student is enrolled in classes, the DSO of the transfer school must update SEVIS to reflect the student's registration and current address, thereby acknowledging that the student has completed the transfer process. In the remarks section of the student's SEVIS Form I-20, the DSO must note that the transfer has been completed, including the date, and return the form to the student. The transfer is effected when the transfer school notifies SEVIS that the student has enrolled in classes in accordance with the 30 days required by &sect; 214.3(g)(3)(iii).</p><p>(D) <em>SEVIS school to non-SEVIS school.</em> To transfer from a SEVIS school to a non-SEVIS school, the student must first notify his or her current school of the intent to transfer and must indicate the school to which he or she intends to transfer. Upon notification by the student, the current school will update the student's status in SEVIS as &ldquo;a transfer out&rdquo;, enter a &ldquo;release&rdquo; or expected transfer date, and update the transfer school as &ldquo;non-SEVIS.&rdquo; The student must then notify the school to which the he or she intends to transfer of his or her intent to enroll. After the student has completed his or her current term or session, or has reached the expected transfer date, the DSO at the current school will no longer have full access to the student's SEVIS record. At this point, if the student has notified the transfer school of his or her intent to transfer, and the transfer school has determined that the student has been maintaining status at his or her current school, the transfer school may issue the student a Form I-20. The transfer will be effected only if the student completes the Student Certification portion of the Form I-20 and returns the form to a designated school official of the transfer school within 15 days of the program start date listed on Form I-20. Upon receipt of the student's Form I-20 the DSO must do as follows: note &ldquo;transfer completed on (date)&rdquo; in the space provided for the DSO's remarks, thereby acknowledging the student's attendance; return the Form I-20 to the student; submit the school copy of the Form I-20 to the Service's data processing center within 30 days of receipt from the student; and forward a photocopy of the school copy to the school from which the student transferred.            </p><p>(iii) <em>Notification.</em> Upon receipt of the student's Form I-20 A-B, the DSO must:</p><p>(A) Note &ldquo;transfer completed on (date)&rdquo; on the student's I-20 ID in the space provided for the DSO's remarks, thereby acknowledging the student's attendance;</p><p>(B) Return the I-20 ID to the student;</p><p>(C) Submit the I-20 School copy to the Service's Data Processing Center within 30 days of receipt from the student; and</p><p>(D) Forward a photocopy of the Form I-20 A-B School Copy to the school from which the student transferred.</p><p>(9) <em>Employment</em>&mdash;(i) <em>On-campus employment.</em> On-campus employment must either be performed on the school's premises, (including on-location commercial firms which provide services for students on campus, such as the school bookstore or cafeteria), or at an off-campus location which is educationally affiliated with the school. Employment with on-site commercial firms, such as a construction company building a school building, which do not provide direct student services is not deemed on-campus employment for the purposes of this paragraph. In the case of off-campus locations, the educational affiliation must be associated with the school's established curriculum or related to contractually funded research projects at the post-graduate level. In any event, the employment must be an integral part of the student's educational program. Employment authorized under this paragraph must not exceed 20 hours a week while school is in session, unless the Commissioner suspends the applicability of this limitation due to emergent circumstances, as determined by the Commissioner, by means of notice in the <em>Federal Register,</em> the student demonstrates to the DSO that the employment is necessary to avoid severe economic hardship resulting from the emergent circumstances, and the DSO notates the Form I-20 in accordance with the <em>Federal Register</em> document. An F-1 student may, however, work on campus full-time when school is not in session or during the annual vacation. A student who has been issued a Form I-20 A-B to begin a new program in accordance with the provision of 8 CFR 214.3(k) and who intends to enroll for the next regular academic year, term, or session at the institution which issued the Form I-20 A-B may continue on-campus employment incident to status. Otherwise, an F-1 student may not engage in on-campus employment after completing a course of study, except employment for practical training as authorized under paragraph (f)(10) of this section. An F-I student may engage in any on-campus employment authorized under this paragraph which will not displace United States residents. In the case of a transfer in SEVIS, the student may only engage in on-campus employment at the school having jurisdiction over the student's SEVIS record. Upon initial entry to begin a new course of study, an F-1 student may not begin on-campus employment more than 30 days prior to the actual start of classes.</p><p>(ii) <em>Off-campus work authorization</em>&mdash;(A) <em>General.</em> An F-1 student may be authorized to work off-campus on a part-time basis in accordance with paragraph (f)(9)(ii) (B) or (C) of this section after having been in F-1 status for one full academic year provided that the student is in good academic standing as determined by the DSO. Part-time off-campus employment authorized under this section is limited to no more than twenty hours a week when school is in session. A student who is granted off-campus employment authorization may work full-time during holidays or school vacation. The employment authorization is automatically terminated whenever the student fails to maintain status. In emergent circumstances as determined by the Commissioner, the Commissioner may suspend the applicability of any or all of the requirements of paragraph (f)(9)(ii) of this section by notice in the <em>Federal Register.</em></p><p>(B) [Reserved]</p><p>(C) <em>Severe economic hardship.</em> If other employment opportunities are not available or are otherwise insufficient, an eligible F-1 student may request off-campus employment work authorization based upon severe economic hardship caused by unforeseen circumstances beyond the student's control. These circumstances may include loss of financial aid or on-campus employment without fault on the part of the student, substantial fluctuations in the value of currency or exchange rate, inordinate increases in tuition and/or living costs, unexpected changes in the financial condition of the student's source of support, medical bills, or other substantial and unexpected expenses.</p><p>(D) <em>Procedure for off-campus employment authorization due to severe economic hardship.</em> The student must request a recommendation from the DSO for off-campus employment. The DSO at a non-SEVIS school must make such a certification on Form I-538, Certification by Designated School Official. The DSO of a SEVIS school must complete such certification in SEVIS. The DSO may recommend the student for work off-campus for one year intervals by certifying that:</p><p>(<em>1</em>) The student has been in F-1 status for one full academic year;</p><p>(<em>2</em>) The student is in good standing as a student and is carrying a full course of study as defined in paragraph (f)(6) of this section;</p><p>(<em>3</em>) The student has demonstrated that acceptance of employment will not interfere with the student's carrying a full course of study; and</p><p>(<em>4</em>) The student has demonstrated that the employment is necessary to avoid severe economic hardship due to unforeseen circumstances beyond the student's control pursuant to paragraph (f)(9)(ii)(C) of this section and has demonstrated that employment under paragraph (f)(9)(i) of this section is unavailable or otherwise insufficient to meet the needs that have arisen as a result of the unforeseen circumstances.</p><p>(E) [Reserved]</p><p>(F) <em>Severe economic hardship application.</em> (<em>1</em>) The applicant should submit the economic hardship application for employment authorization on Form I-765, with the fee required by 8 CFR 103.7(b)(1), to the service center having jurisdiction over his or her place of residence. Applicants at a non-SEVIS school should submit Form I-20, Form I-538, and any other supporting materials such as affidavits which further detail the unforeseen circumstances that require the student to seek employment authorization and the unavailability or insufficiency of employment under paragraph (f)(9)(i) of this section. Students enrolled in a SEVIS school should submit the SEVIS Form I-20 with the employment page demonstrating the DSO's comments and certification.</p><p>(<em>2</em>) The Service shall adjudicate the application for work authorization based upon severe economic hardship on the basis of Form I-20 ID, Form I-538, and Form I-765, and any additional supporting materials. If employment is authorized, the adjudicating officer shall issue an EAD. The Service director shall notify the student of the decision, and, if the application is denied, of the reason or reasons for the denial. No appeal shall lie from a decision to deny a request for employment authorization under this section. The employment authorization may be granted in one year intervals up to the expected date of completion of the student's current course of study. A student has permission to engage in off-campus employment only if the student receives the EAD endorsed to that effect. Off-campus employment authorization may be renewed by the Service only if the student is maintaining status and good academic standing. The employment authorization is automatically terminated whenever the student fails to maintain status.</p><p>(iii) <em>Internship with an international organization.</em> A bona fide F-1 student who has been offered employment by a recognized international organization within the meaning of the International Organization Immunities Act (59 Stat. 669) must apply for employment authorization to the service center having jurisdiction over his or her place of residence. A student seeking employment authorization under this provision is required to present a written certification from the international organization that the proposed employment is within the scope of the organization's sponsorship, Form I-20 ID or SEVIS Form I-20 with employment page completed by DSO certifying eligibility for employment, and a completed Form I-765, with required fee as contained in &sect; 103.7(b)(1) of this chapter.            </p><p>(10) <em>Practical training.</em> Practical training may be authorized to an F-1 student who has been lawfully enrolled on a full time basis, in a Service-approved college, university, conservatory, or seminary for one full academic year. This provision also includes students who, during their course of study, were enrolled in a study abroad program, if the student had spent at least one full academic term enrolled in a full course of study in the United States prior to studying abroad. A student may be authorized 12 months of practical training, and becomes eligible for another 12 months of practical training when he or she changes to a higher educational level. Students in English language training programs are ineligible for practical training. An eligible student may request employment authorization for practical training in a position that is directly related to his or her major area of study. There are two types of practical training available:</p><p>(i) <em>Curricular practical training.</em> An F-1 student may be authorized by the DSO to participate in a curricular practical training program that is an integral part of an established curriculum. Curricular practical training is defined to be alternative work/study, internship, cooperative education, or any other type of required internship or practicum that is offered by sponsoring employers through cooperative agreements with the school. Students who have received one year or more of full time curricular practical training are ineligible for post-completion academic training. Exceptions to the one academic year requirement are provided for students enrolled in graduate studies that require immediate participation in curricular practical training. A request for authorization for curricular practical training must be made to the DSO. A student may begin curricular practical training only after receiving his or her Form I-20 with the DSO endorsement.</p><p>(A) <em>Non-SEVIS process.</em> A student must request authorization for curricular practical training using Form I-538. Upon approving the request for authorization, the DSO shall: certify Form I-538 and send the form to the Service's data processing center; endorse the student's Form I-20 ID with &ldquo;full-time (or part-time) curricular practical training authorized for (employer) at (location) from (date) to (date)&rdquo;; and sign and date the Form I-20ID before returning it to the student.</p><p>(B) <em>SEVIS process.</em> To grant authorization for a student to engage in curricular practical training, a DSO at a SEVIS school will update the student's record in SEVIS as being authorized for curricular practical training that is directly related to the student's major area of study. The DSO will indicate whether the training is full-time or part-time, the employer and location, and the employment start and end date. The DSO will then print a copy of the employment page of the SEVIS Form I-20 indicating that curricular practical training has been approved. The DSO must sign, date, and return the SEVIS Form I-20 to the student prior to the student's commencement of employment.</p><p>(ii) <em>Optional practical training</em>.</p><p>(A) <em>General.</em> Consistent with the application and approval process in paragraph (f)(11) of this section, a student may apply to USCIS for authorization for temporary employment for optional practical training directly related to the student's major area of study. The student may not begin optional practical training until the date indicated on his or her employment authorization document, Form I-766. A student may be granted authorization to engage in temporary employment for optional practical training:</p><p>(<em>1</em>) During the student's annual vacation and at other times when school is not in session, if the student is currently enrolled, and is eligible for registration and intends to register for the next term or session;</p><p>(<em>2</em>) While school is in session, provided that practical training does not exceed 20 hours a week while school is in session; or</p><p>(<em>3</em>) After completion of the course of study, or, for a student in a bachelor's, master's, or doctoral degree program, after completion of all course requirements for the degree (excluding thesis or equivalent). Continued enrollment, for the school's administrative purposes, after all requirements for the degree have been met does not preclude eligibility for optional practical training. A student must complete all practical training within a 14-month period following the completion of study, except that a 17-month extension pursuant to paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C) of this section does not need to be completed within such 14-month period.</p><p>(B) <em>Termination of practical training.</em> Authorization to engage in optional practical training employment is automatically terminated when the student transfers to another school or begins study at another educational level.</p><p>(C) <em>17-month extension of post-completion OPT for students with a science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) degree.</em> Consistent with paragraph (f)(11)(i)(C) of this section, a qualified student may apply for an extension of OPT while in a valid period of post-completion OPT. The extension will be for an additional 17 months, for a maximum of 29 months of OPT, if all of the following requirements are met.</p><p>(<em>1</em>) The student has not previously received a 17-month OPT extension after earning a STEM degree.</p><p>(<em>2</em>) The degree that was the basis for the student's current period of OPT is a bachelor's, master's, or doctoral degree in one of the degree programs on the current STEM Designated Degree Program List, published on the SEVP Web site at <em>http://www.ice.gov/sevis.</em></p><p>(<em>3</em>) The student's employer is registered in the E-Verify program, as evidenced by either a valid E-Verify company identification number or, if the employer is using a designated agent to perform the E-Verify queries, a valid E-Verify client company identification number, and the employer is a participant in good standing in the E-Verify program, as determined by USCIS.</p><p>(<em>4</em>) The employer agrees to report the termination or departure of an OPT employee to the DSO at the student's school or through any other means or process identified by DHS if the termination or departure is prior to end of the authorized period of OPT. Such reporting must be made within 48 hours of the event. An employer shall consider a worker to have departed when the employer knows the student has left the employment or if the student has not reported for work for a period of 5 consecutive business days without the consent of the employer, whichever occurs earlier.</p><p>(D) <em>Action of the DSO-Non SEVIS schools.</em> In making a recommendation for practical training, a designated school official must:</p><p>(<em>1</em>) Certify on Form I-538 that the proposed employment is directly related to the student's major area of study and commensurate with the student's educational level;</p><p>(<em>2</em>) Endorse and date the student's Form I-20 ID to show that practical training in the student's major field of study is recommended &ldquo;full-time (or part-time) from (date) to (date)&rdquo;; and</p><p>(<em>3</em>) Return to the student the Form I-20 ID and send to the Service data processing center the school certification on Form I-538.</p><p>(E) <em>Periods of unemployment during post-completion OPT</em>. During post-completion OPT, F-1 status is dependent upon employment. Students may not accrue an aggregate of more than 90 days of unemployment during any post-completion OPT carried out under the initial post-completion OPT authorization. Students granted a 17-month OPT extension may not accrue an aggregate of more than 120 days of unemployment during the total OPT period comprising any post-completion OPT carried out under the initial post-completion OPT authorization and the subsequent 17-month extension period.</p><p>(11) <em>OPT application and approval process</em>.</p><p>(i) <em>Student responsibilities</em>. A student must initiate the OPT application process by requesting a recommendation for OPT from his or her DSO. Upon making the recommendation, the DSO will provide the student a signed Form I-20 indicating that recommendation.</p><p>(A) <em>Application for employment authorization</em>. The student must properly file a Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, with USCIS, accompanied by the required fee for the Form I-765, and the supporting documents, as described in the form's instructions.</p><p>(B) <em>Filing deadlines for pre-completion OPT and post-completion OPT</em>.            </p><p>(<em>1</em>) Students may file a Form I-765 for pre-completion OPT up to 90 days before being enrolled for one full academic year, provided that the period of employment will not start prior to the completion of the full academic year.</p><p>(<em>2</em>) For post-completion OPT, the student must properly file his or her Form I-765 up to 90 days prior to his or her program end-date and no later than 60 days after his or her program end-date. The student must also file the Form I-765 with USCIS within 30 days of the date the DSO enters the recommendation for OPT into his or her SEVIS record.</p><p>(C) <em>Applications for 17-month OPT extension</em>. A student meeting the eligibility requirement in paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(C) of this section may file for a 17-month extension of employment authorization by filing Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, with the appropriate fee, prior to the expiration date of the student's current OPT employment authorization. If a student timely and properly files an application for a 17-month OPT extension, but the Form I-766, Employment Authorization Document, currently in the student's possession, expires prior to the decision on the student's application for 17-month OPT extension, the student's Form I-766 is extended automatically pursuant to the terms and conditions specified in 8 CFR 274a.12(b)(6)(iv).</p><p>(D) <em>Start of employment.</em> A student may not begin employment prior to the approved starting date on his or her employment authorization except as noted in paragraph (f)(11)(i)(C) of this section. A student may not request a start date that is more than 60 days after the student's program end date. Employment authorization will begin on the date requested or the date the employment authorization is adjudicated, whichever is later.</p><p>(ii) <em>DSO responsibilities</em>. A student needs a recommendation from his or her DSO in order to apply for OPT. When a DSO recommends a student for OPT, the school assumes the added responsibility for maintaining the SEVIS record of that student for the entire period of authorized OPT, consistent with paragraph (f)(12) of this section.</p><p>(A) Prior to making a recommendation, the DSO must ensure that the student is eligible for the given type and period of OPT and that the student is aware of his or her responsibilities for maintaining status while on OPT. Prior to recommending a 17-month OPT extension, the DSO must certify that the student's degree, as shown in SEVIS, is a bachelor's, master's, or doctorate degree with a degree code that is on the current STEM Designated Degree Program List.</p><p>(B) The DSO must update the student's SEVIS record with the DSO's recommendation for OPT before the student can apply to USCIS for employment authorization. The DSO will indicate in SEVIS whether the employment is to be full-time or part-time, and note in SEVIS the start and end date of employment.</p><p>(C) The DSO must provide the student with a signed, dated Form I-20 indicating that OPT has been recommended.</p><p>(iii) <em>Decision on application for OPT employment authorization</em>. USCIS will adjudicate the Form I-765 and, if approved, issue an EAD on the basis of the DSO's recommendation and other eligibility considerations.</p><p>(A) The employment authorization period for post-completion OPT begins on the date requested or the date the employment authorization application is approved, whichever is later, and ends at the conclusion of the remaining time period of post-completion OPT eligibility. The employment authorization period for the 17-month OPT extension begins on the day after the expiration of the initial post-completion OPT employment authorization and ends 17 months thereafter, regardless of the date the actual extension is approved.</p><p>(B) USCIS will notify the applicant of the decision and, if the application is denied, of the reason or reasons for the denial.</p><p>(C) The applicant may not appeal the decision.</p><p>(12) <em>Reporting while on optional practical training</em>.</p><p>(i) <em>General.</em> An F-1 student who is authorized by USCIS to engage in optional practical training (OPT) employment is required to report any change of name or address, or interruption of such employment to the DSO for the duration of the optional practical training. A DSO who recommends a student for OPT is responsible for updating the student's record to reflect these reported changes for the duration of the time that training is authorized.</p><p>(ii) <em>Additional reporting obligations for students with an approved 17-month OPT.</em> Students with an approved 17-month OPT extension have additional reporting obligations. Compliance with these reporting requirements is required to maintain F-1 status. The reporting obligations are:</p><p>(A) Within 10 days of the change, the student must report to the student's DSO a change of legal name, residential or mailing address, employer name, employer address, and/or loss of employment.</p><p>(B) The student must make a validation report to the DSO every six months starting from the date the extension begins and ending when the student's F-1 status ends, the student changes educational levels at the same school, or the student transfers to another school or program, or the 17-month OPT extension ends, whichever is first. The validation is a confirmation that the student's information in SEVIS for the items in listed in paragraph (f)(12)(ii)(A) of this section is current and accurate. This report is due to the student's DSO within 10 business days of each reporting date.</p><p>(13) <em>Temporary absence from the United States of F-1 student granted employment authorization.</em> (i) A student returning from a temporary trip abroad with an unexpired off-campus employment authorization on his or her I-20 ID may resume employment only if the student is readmitted to attend the same school which granted the employment authorization.</p><p>(ii) An F-1 student who has an unexpired EAD issued for post-completion practical training and who is otherwise admissible may return to the United States to resume employment after a period of temporary absence. The EAD must be used in combination with an I-20 ID endorsed for reentry by the DSO within the last six months.</p><p>(14) <em>Effect of strike or other labor dispute.</em> Any employment authorization, whether or not part of an academic program, is automatically suspended upon certification by the Secretary of Labor or the Secretary's designee to the Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service or the Commissioner's designee, that a strike or other labor dispute involving a work stoppage of workers is in progress in the occupation at the place of employment. As used in this paragraph, &ldquo;place of employment&rdquo; means the facility or facilities where a labor dispute exists. The employer is prohibited from transferring F-1 students working at other facilities to the facility where the work stoppage is occurring.</p><p>(15) <em>Spouse and children of F-1 student.</em> The F-2 spouse and minor children of an F-1 student shall each be issued an individual SEVIS Form I-20 in accordance with the provisions of &sect; 214.3(k).</p><p>(i) <em>Employment.</em> The F-2 spouse and children of an F-1 student may not accept employment.</p><p>(ii) <em>Study.</em> (A) The F-2 spouse of an F-1 student may not engage in full time study, and the F-2 child may only engage in full time study if the study is in an elementary or secondary school (kindergarten through twelfth grade). The F-2 spouse and child may engage in study that is avocational or recreational in nature.</p><p>(B) An F-2 spouse or F-2 child desiring to engage in full time study, other than that allowed for a child in paragraph (f)(15)(ii)(A) of this section, must apply for and obtain a change of nonimmigrant classification to F-1, J-1, or M-1 status. An F-2 spouse or child who was enrolled on a full time basis prior to January 1, 2003, will be allowed to continue study but must file for a change of nonimmigrant classification to F-1, J-1, or M-1 status on or before March 11, 2003.</p><p>(C) An F-2 spouse or F-2 child violates his or her nonimmigrant status by engaging in full time study except as provided in paragraph (f)(15)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section.</p><p>(16) <em>Reinstatement to student status</em>&mdash;(i) <em>General.</em> The district director may consider reinstating a student who makes a request for reinstatement on Form I-539, Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status, accompanied by a properly completed SEVIS Form I-20 indicating the DSO's recommendation for reinstatement (or a properly completed Form I-20A-B issued prior to January 30, 2003, from the school the student is attending or intends to attend prior to August 1, 2003). The district director may consider granting the request if the student:</p><p>(A) Has not been out of status for more than 5 months at the time of filing the request for reinstatement (or demonstrates that the failure to file within the 5 month period was the result of exceptional circumstances and that the student filed the request for reinstatement as promptly as possible under these exceptional circumstances);</p><p>(B) Does not have a record of repeated or willful violations of Service regulations;</p><p>(C) Is currently pursuing, or intending to pursue, a full course of study in the immediate future at the school which issued the Form I-20;</p><p>(D) Has not engaged in unauthorized employment;</p><p>(E) Is not deportable on any ground other than section 237(a)(1)(B) or (C)(i) of the Act; and</p><p>(F) Establishes to the satisfaction of the Service, by a detailed showing, either that:</p><p>(<em>1</em>) The violation of status resulted from circumstances beyond the student's control. Such circumstances might include serious injury or illness, closure of the institution, a natural disaster, or inadvertence, oversight, or neglect on the part of the DSO, but do not include instances where a pattern of repeated violations or where a willful failure on the part of the student resulted in the need for reinstatement; or</p><p>(<em>2</em>) The violation relates to a reduction in the student's course load that would have been within a DSO's power to authorize, and that failure to approve reinstatement would result in extreme hardship to the student.</p><p>(ii) <em>Decision.</em> If the Service reinstates the student, the Service shall endorse the student's copy of Form I-20 to indicate the student has been reinstated and return the form to the student. If the Form I-20 is from a non-SEVIS school, the school copy will be forwarded to the school. If the Form I-20 is from a SEVIS school, the adjudicating officer will update SEVIS to reflect the Service's decision. In either case, if the Service does not reinstate the student, the student may not appeal that decision.</p><p>(17) <em>Current name and address.</em> A student must inform the DSO and the Service of any legal changes to his or her name or of any change of address, within 10 days of the change, in a manner prescribed by the school. A student enrolled at a SEVIS school can satisfy the requirement in 8 CFR 265.1 of notifying the Service by providing a notice of a change of address within 10 days to the DSO, who in turn shall enter the information in SEVIS within 21 days of notification by the student. A student enrolled at a non-SEVIS school must submit a notice of change of address to the Service, as provided in 8 CFR 265.1, within 10 days of the change. Except in the case of a student who cannot receive mail where he or she resides, the address provided by the student must be the actual physical location where the student resides rather than a mailing address. In cases where a student provides a mailing address, the school must maintain a record of, and must provide upon request from the Service, the actual physical location where the student resides.</p><p>(18) <em>Special rules for certain border commuter students</em>&mdash;(i) <em>Applicability.</em> For purposes of the special rules in this paragraph (f)(18), the term &ldquo;border commuter student&rdquo; means a national of Canada or Mexico who is admitted to the United States as an F-1 nonimmigrant student to enroll in a full course of study, albeit on a part-time basis, in an approved school located within 75 miles of a United States land border. A border commuter student must maintain actual residence and place of abode in the student's country of nationality, and seek admission to the United States at a land border port-of-entry. These special rules do not apply to a national of Canada or Mexico who is:</p><p>(A) Residing in the United States while attending an approved school as an F-1 student, or</p><p>(B) Enrolled in a full course of study as defined in paragraph (f)(6) of this section.            </p><p>(ii) <em>Full course of study.</em> The border commuter student must be enrolled in a full course of study at the school that leads to the attainment of a specific educational or professional objective, albeit on a part-time basis. A designated school official at the school may authorize an eligible border commuter student to enroll in a course load below that otherwise required for a full course of study under paragraph (f)(6) of this section, provided that the reduced course load is consistent with the border commuter student's approved course of study.</p><p>(iii) <em>Period of admission.</em> An F-1 nonimmigrant student who is admitted as a border commuter student under this paragraph (f)(18) will be admitted until a date certain. The DSO is required to specify a completion date on the Form I-20 that reflects the actual semester or term dates for the commuter student's current term of study. A new Form I-20 will be required for each new semester or term that the border commuter student attends at the school. The provisions of paragraphs (f)(5) and (f)(7) of this section, relating to duration of status and extension of stay, are not applicable to a border commuter student.</p><p>(iv) <em>Employment.</em> A border commuter student may not be authorized to accept any employment in connection with his or her F-1 student status, except for curricular practical training as provided in paragraph (f)(10)(i) of this section or post-completion optional practical training as provided in paragraph (f)(10)(ii)(A)(<em>3</em>) of this section.</p><p>(19) <em>Remittance of the fee.</em> An alien who applies for F-1 or F-3 nonimmigrant status in order to enroll in a program of study at a Department of Homeland Security (DHS)-approved educational institution is required to pay the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) fee to DHS, pursuant to 8 CFR 214.13, except as otherwise provided in that section.</p><p>(g) <em>Representatives to international organizations</em>&mdash;(1) <em>General.</em> The determination by a consular officer prior to admission and the recognition by the Secretary of State subsequent to admission is evidence of the proper classification of a nonimmigrant under section 101(a)(15)(G) of the Act. An alien who has a nonimmigrant status under section 101(a)(15)(G) (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) of the Act is to be admitted for the duration of the period for which the alien continues to be recognized by the Secretary of State as being entitled to that status. An alien defined in section (101)(a)(15)(G)(v) of the Act is to be admitted for an initial period of not more than three years, and may be granted extensions of temporary stay in increments of not more than two years. In addition, the application for extension of temporary stay must be accompanied by a statement signed by the employing official stating that he or she intends to continue to employ the applicant and describing the type of work the applicant will perform.</p><p>(2) <em>Definition of G-1, G-3, or G-4 dependent.</em> For purposes of employment in the United States, the term <em>dependent</em> of a G-1, G-3, or G-4 principal alien, as used in &sect; 214.2(g), means any of the following immediate members of the family habitually residing in the same household as the principal alien who is an officer or employee assigned to a mission, to an international organization, or is employed by an international organization in the United States:</p><p>(i) Spouse;</p><p>(ii) Unmarried children under the age of 21;</p><p>(iii) Unmarried sons or daughters under the age of 23 who are in full-time attendance as students at post-secondary educational institutions;</p><p>(iv) Unmarried sons or daughters under the age of 25 who are in full-time attendance as students at post-secondary educational institutions if a formal bilateral employment agreement permitting their employment in the United States was signed prior to November 21, 1988, and such bilateral employment agreement does not specify 23 as the maximum age for employment of such sons and daughters. The Office of Protocol of the Department of State shall maintain a listing of foreign states which the United States has such bilateral employment agreements. The provisions of this paragraph apply only to G-1 and G-3 dependents under certain bilateral agreements and are not applicable to G-4 dependents; and            </p><p>(v) Unmarried sons or daughters who are physically or mentally disabled to the extent that they cannot adequately care for themselves or cannot establish, maintain, or re-establish their own households. The Department of State or the Service may require certification(s) as it deems sufficient to document such mental or physical disability.</p><p>(3) <em>Applicability of a formal bilateral agreement or an informal de facto arrangement for G-1 and G-3 dependents.</em> The applicability of a formal bilateral agreement shall be based on the foreign state which employs the principal alien and not on the nationality of the principal alien or dependent. The applicability of an informal de facto arrangement shall be based on the foreign state which employs the principal alien, but under a de facto arrangement the principal alien also must be a national of the foreign state which employs him or her in the United States.</p><p>(4) <em>Income tax, Social Security liability; non-applicability of certain immunities.</em> Dependents who are granted employment authorization under this section are responsible for payment of all federal, state and local income, employment and related taxes and Social Security contributions on any remuneration received. In addition, immunity from civil or administrative jurisdiction in accordance with Article 37 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations or other international agreements does not apply to these dependents with respect to matters arising out of their employment.</p><p>(5) <em>G-1 and G-3 dependent employment pursuant to formal bilateral employment agreements and informal de facto reciprocal arrangements, and G-4 dependent employment.</em> (i) The Office of Protocol shall maintain a listing of foreign states which have entered into formal bilateral employment agreements. Dependents of a G-1 or G-3 principal alien assigned to official duty in the United States may accept or continue in unrestricted employment based on such formal bilateral agreements, if the applicable agreement includes persons in G-1 or G-3 visa status, upon favorable recommendation by the Department of State and issuance of employment authorization documentation by the Service in accordance with 8 CFR part 274a. The application procedures are set forth in paragrpah (g)(6) of this section.</p><p>(ii) For purposes of this section, an informal de facto reciprocal arrangement exists when the Department of State determines that a foreign state allows appropriate employment on the local economy for dependents of certain United States officials assigned to duty in that foreign state. The Office of Protocol shall maintain a listing of countries with which such reciprocity exists. Dependents of a G-1 or G-3 principal alien assigned to official duty in the United States may be authorized to accept or continue in employment based upon informal de facto arrangements, and dependents of a G-4 principal alien assigned to official duty in the United States may be authorized to accept or continue in employment upon favorable recommendation by the Department of State and issuance of employment authorization by the Service in accordance with 8 CFR part 274a. Additionally, the procedures set forth in paragraph (g)(6) of this section must be complied with, and the following conditions must be met:</p><p>(A) Both the principal alien and the dependent desiring employment are maintaining G-1, G-3, or G-4 status as appropriate;</p><p>(B) The principal's assignment in the United States is expected to last more than six months;</p><p>(C) Employment of a similar nature for dependents of United States Government officials assigned to official duty in the foreign state employing the principal alien is not prohibited by that foreign government. The provisions of this paragraph apply only to G-1 and G-3 dependents;</p><p>(D) The proposed employment is not in an occupation listed in the Department of Labor Schedule B (20 CFR part 656), or otherwise determined by the Department of Labor to be one for which there is an oversupply of qualified U.S. workers in the area of proposed employment. This Schedule B restriction does not apply to a dependent son or daughter who is a full-time student if the employment is part-time, consisting of not more than 20 hours per week, and/or if it is temporary employment of not more than 12 weeks during school holiday periods; and</p><p>(E) The proposed employment is not contrary to the interest of the United States. Employment contrary to the interest of the United States includes, but is not limited to, the employment of G-1, G-3, or G-4 dependents: who have criminal records; who have violated United States immigration laws or regulations, or visa laws or regulations; who have worked illegally in the United States; and/or who cannot establish that they have paid taxes and social security on income from current or previous United States employment. Additionally, the Department of State may determine a G-4 dependent's employment is contrary to the interest of the United States when the principal alien's country of nationality has one or more components of an international organization or international organizations within its borders and does not allow the employment of dependents of United States citizens employed by such component(s) or organization(s).</p><p>(6) <em>Application procedures.</em> The following procedures are applicable to G-1 and G-3 dependent employment applications under bilateral agreements and de facto arrangements, as well as to G-4 dependent employment applications:</p><p>(i) The dependent must submit a completed Form I-566 to the Department of State through the office, mission, or organization which employs his or her principal alien. If the principal is assigned to or employed by the United Nations, the Form I-566 must be submitted to the U.S. Mission to the United Nations. All other applications must be submitted to the Office of Protocol of the Department of State. A dependent applying under paragraph (g)(2) (iii) or (iv) of this section must submit a certified statement from the post-secondary educational institution confirming that he or she is pursuing studies on a full-time basis. A dependent applying under paragraph (g)(2)(v) of this section must submit medical certification regarding his or her condition. The certification should identify the dependent and the certifying physician and give the physician's phone number; identify the condition, describe the symptoms and provide a prognosis; certify that the dependent is unable to establish, re-establish, and maintain a home or his or her own. Additionally, a G-1 or G-3 dependent applying under the terms of a de facto arrangement or a G-4 dependent must attach a statement from the prospective employer which includes the dependent's name; a description of the position offered and the duties to be performed; the salary offered; and verification that the dependent possesses the qualifications for the position.</p><p>(ii) The Department of State reviews and verifies the information provided, makes its determination, and endorses the Form I-566.</p><p>(iii) If the Department of State's endorsement is favorable, the dependent may apply to the Service. A dependent whose principal alien is stationed at a post in Washington, DC, or New York City shall apply to the District Director, Washington, DC, or New York City, respectively. A dependent whose principal alien is stationed elsewhere shall apply to the District Director, Washington, DC, unless the Service, through the Department of State, directs the dependent to apply to the district director having jurisdiction over his or her place of residence. Directors of the regional service centers may have concurrent adjudicative authority for applications filed within their respective regions. When applying to the Service, the dependent must present his or her Form I-566 with a favorable endorsement from the Department of State and any additional documentation as may be required by the Attorney General.</p><p>(7) <em>Period of time for which employment may be authorized.</em> If approved, an application to accept or continue employment under this section shall be granted in increments of not more than three years each.</p><p>(8) <em>No appeal.</em> There shall be no appeal from a denial of permission to accept or continue employment under this section.</p><p>(9) <em>Dependents or family members of principal aliens classified G-2 or G-5.</em> A dependent or family member of a principal alien classified G-2 or G-5 may not be employed in the United States under this section.</p><p>(10) <em>Unauthorized employment.</em> An alien classified under section 101(a)(15)(G) of the Act who is not a principal alien and who engages in employment outside the scope of, or in a manner contrary to this section, may be considered in violation of section 241(a)(1)(C)(i) of the Act. An alien who is classified under section 101(a)(15)(G) of the Act who is a principal alien and who engages in employment outside the scope of his/her official position may be considered in violation of section 241(a)(1)(C)(i) of the Act.</p><p>(11) <em>Special provision.</em> As of February 16, 1990 no new employment authorization will be granted and no pre-existing employment authorization will be extended for a G-1 dependent absent an appropriate bilateral agreement or de facto arrangement. However, a G-1 dependent who has been granted employment authorization by the Department of State prior to the effective date of this section and who meets the definition of dependent under &sect; 214.2(g)(2) (i), (ii), (iii) or (v) of this part but is not covered by the terms of a bilateral agreement or de facto arrangement may be allowed to continue in employment until whichever of the following occurs first:</p><p>(i) The employment authorization by the Department of State expires; or</p><p>(ii) He or she no longer qualifies as a dependent as that term is defined in this section; or</p><p>(iii) March 19, 1990.</p><p>(h) <em>Temporary employees</em>&mdash;(1) <em>Admission of temporary employees</em>&mdash;(i) <em>General.</em> Under section 101(a)(15)(H) of the Act, an alien may be authorized to come to the United States temporarily to perform services or labor for, or to receive training from, an employer, if petitioned for by that employer. Under this nonimmigrant category, the alien may be classified as follows: under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c) of the Act as a registered nurse; under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) of the Act as an alien who is coming to perform services in a specialty occupation, services relating to a Department of Defense (DOD) cooperative research and development project or coproduction project, or services as a fashion model who is of distinguished merit and ability; under section 101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a) of the Act as an alien who is coming to perform agricultural labor or services of a temporary or seasonal nature; under section 101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(b) of the Act as an alien coming to perform other temporary services or labor; or under section 101(a)(15)(H)(iii) of the Act as an alien who is coming as a trainee or as a participant in a special education exchange visitor program. These classifications are called H-1C, H-1B, H-2A, H-2B, and H-3, respectively. The employer must file a petition with the Service for review of the services or training and for determination of the alien's eligibility for classification as a temporary employee or trainee, before the alien may apply for a visa or seek admission to the United States. This paragraph sets forth the standards and procedures applicable to these classifications.</p><p>(ii) <em>Description of classifications.</em> (A) An H-1C classification applies to an alien who is coming temporarily to the United States to perform services as a registered nurse, meets the requirements of section 212(m)(1) of the Act, and will perform services at a facility (as defined at section 212(m)(6) of the Act) for which the Secretary of Labor has determined and certified to the Attorney General that an unexpired attestation is on file and in effect under section 212(m)(2) of the Act. This classification will expire 4 years from June 11, 2001.</p><p>(B) An H-1B classification applies to an alien who is coming temporarily to the United States:</p><p>(<em>1</em>) To perform services in a specialty occupation (except agricultural workers, and aliens described in section 101(a)(15) (O) and (P) of the Act) described in section 214(i)(1) of the Act, that meets the requirements of section 214(i)(2) of the Act, and for whom the Secretary of Labor has determined and certified to the Attorney General that the prospective employer has filed a labor condition application under section 212(n)(1) of the Act;</p><p>(<em>2</em>) To perform services of an exceptional nature requiring exceptional merit and ability relating to a cooperative research and development project or a coproduction project provided for under a Government-to-Government agreement administered by the Secretary of Defense;</p><p>(<em>3</em>) To perform services as a fashion model of distinguished merit and ability and for whom the Secretary of Labor has determined and certified to the Attorney General that the prospective employer has filed a labor condition application under section 212(n)(1) of the Act.</p><p>(C) An H-2A classification applies to an alien who is coming temporarily to the United States to perform agricultural work of a temporary or seasonal nature.</p><p>(D) An H-2B classification applies to an alien who is coming temporarily to the United States to perform nonagricultural work of a temporary or seasonal nature, if unemployed persons capable of performing such service or labor cannot be found in this country. This classification does not apply to graduates of medical schools coming to the United States to perform services as members of the medical profession. The temporary or permanent nature of the services or labor to be performed must be determined by the service. This classification requires a temporary labor certification issued by the Secretary of Labor or the Governor of Guam, or a notice from one of these individuals that such a certification cannot be made, prior to the filing of a petition with the Service.</p><p>(E) An H-3 classification applies to an alien who is coming temporarily to the United States:</p><p>(<em>1</em>) As a trainee, other than to receive graduate medical education or training, or training provided primarily at or by an academic or vocational institution, or</p><p>(<em>2</em>) As a participant in a special education exchange visitor program which provides for practical training and experience in the education of children with physical, mental, or emotional disabilities.</p><p>(2) <em>Petitions</em>&mdash;(i) <em>Filing of petitions</em>&mdash;(A) <em>General.</em> A United States employer seeking to classify an alien as an H-1B, H-2A, H-2B, or H-3, temporary employee shall file a petition on Form I-129, Petition for Nonimmigrant Worker, only with the USCIS Service Center which has jurisdiction in the area where the alien will perform services, or receive training, even in emergent situations, except as provided in this section or as specifically designated by USCIS via notice in the <em>Federal Register</em>.</p><p>(B) <em>Service or training in more than one location.</em> A petition which requires services to be performed or training to be received in more than one location must include an itinerary with the dates and locations of the services or training and must be filed with the Service office which has jurisdiction over I-129H petitions in the area where the petitioner is located. The address which the petitioner specifies as its location on the I-129H petition shall be where the petitioner is located for purposes of this paragraph.</p><p>(C) <em>Services or training for more than one employer.</em> If the beneficiary will perform nonagricultural services for, or receive training from, more than one employer, each employer must file a separate petition with the Service Center that has jurisdiction over the area where the alien will perform services or receive training, unless an established agent files the petition.</p><p>(D) <em>Change of employers.</em> If the alien is in the United States and seeks to change employers, the prospective new employer must file a petition on Form I-129 requesting classification and extension of the alien's stay in the United States. If the new petition is approved, the extension of stay may be granted for the validity of the approved petition. The validity of the petition and the alien's extension of stay shall conform to the limits on the alien's temporary stay that are prescribed in paragraph (h)(13) of this section. The alien is not authorized to begin the employment with the new petitioner until the petition is approved. An H-1C nonimmigrant alien may not change employers.</p><p>(E) <em>Amended or new petition.</em> The petitioner shall file an amended or new petition, with fee, with the Service Center where the original petition was filed to reflect any material changes in the terms and conditions of employment or training or the alien's eligibility as specified in the original approved petition. An amended or new H-1C, H-1B, H-2A, or H-2B petition must be accompanied by a current or new Department of Labor determination. In the case of an H-1B petition, this requirement includes a new labor condition application.</p><p>(F) <em>Agents as petitioners.</em> A United States agent may file a petition in cases involving workers who are traditionally self-employed or workers who use agents to arrange short-term employment on their behalf with numerous employers, and in cases where a foreign employer authorizes the agent to act on its behalf. A United States agent may be: the actual employer of the beneficiary, the representative of both the employer and the beneficiary, or, a person or entity authorized by the employer to act for, or in place of, the employer as it agent. A petition filed by a United States agent is subject to the following conditions;</p><p>(<em>1</em>) An agent performing the function of an employer must guarantee the wages and other terms and conditions of employment by contractual agreement with the beneficiary or beneficiaries of the petition. The agent/employer must also provide an itinerary of definite employment and information on any other services planned for the period of time requested.</p><p>(<em>2</em>) A person or company in business as an agent may file the H petition involving multiple employers as the representative of both the employers and the beneficiary or beneficiaries if the supporting documentation includes a complete itinerary of services or engagements. The itinerary shall specify the dates of each service or engagement, the names and addresses of the actual employers, and the names and addresses of the establishment, venues, or locations where the services will be performed. In questionable cases, a contract between the employers and the beneficiary or beneficiaries may be required. The burden is on the agent to explain the terms and conditions of the employment and to provide any required documentation.</p><p>(<em>3</em>) A foreign employer who, through a United States agent, files a petition for an H nonimmigrant alien is responsible for complying with all of the employer sanctions provisions of section 274A of the Act and 8 CFR part 274a.</p><p>(G) <em>Multiple H-1B petitions.</em> An employer may not file, in the same fiscal year, more than one H-1B petition on behalf of the same alien if the alien is subject to the numerical limitations of section 214(g)(1)(A) of the Act or is exempt from those limitations under section 214(g)(5)(C) of the Act. If an H-1B petition is denied, on a basis other than fraud or misrepresentation, the employer may file a subsequent H-1B petition on behalf of the same alien in the same fiscal year, provided that the numerical limitation has not been reached or if the filing qualifies as exempt from the numerical limitation. Otherwise, filing more than one H-1B petition by an employer on behalf of the same alien in the same fiscal year will result in the denial or revocation of all such petitions. If USCIS believes that related entities (such as a parent company, subsidiary, or affiliate) may not have a legitimate business need to file more than one H-1B petition on behalf of the same alien subject to the numerical limitations of section 214(g)(1)(A) of the Act or otherwise eligible for an exemption under section 214(g)(5)(C) of the Act, USCIS may issue a request for additional evidence or notice of intent to deny, or notice of intent to revoke each petition. If any of the related entities fail to demonstrate a legitimate business need to file an H-1B petition on behalf of the same alien, all petitions filed on that alien's behalf by the related entities will be denied or revoked.</p><p>(ii) <em>Multiple beneficiaries.</em> More than one beneficiary may be included in an H-1C, H-2A, H-2B, or H-3 petition if the beneficiaries will be performing the same service, or receiving the same training, for the same period of time, and in the same location</p><p>(iii) <em>Named beneficiaries.</em> Nonagricultural petitions must include the names of beneficiaries and other required information at the time of filing. Under the H-2B classification, exceptions may be granted in emergent situations involving multiple beneficiaries at the discretion of the director, and in special filing situations as determined by the Service's Headquarters. If all of the beneficiaries covered by an H-2A or H-2B labor certification have not been identified at the time a petition is filed, multiple petitions naming subsequent beneficiaries may be filed at different times with a copy of the same labor certification. Each petition must reference all previously filed petitions for that labor certification.</p><p>(iv) <em>Substitution of beneficiaries.</em> Beneficiaries may be substituted in and H-2B petitions that are approved for a group, or H-2B petitions that are approved for unnamed beneficiaries, or approved H-2B petitions where the job offered to the alien(s) does not require any education, training, and/or experience.

The director shall determine if the application involves a specialty occupation as defined in section 214(i)(1) of the Act. The director shall also determine whether the particular alien for whom H-1B classification is sought qualifies to perform services in the specialty occupation as prescribed in section 214(i)(2) of the Act.</p><p>(<em>3</em>) If all of the beneficiaries covered by an H-1B labor condition application have not been identified at the time a petition is filed, petitions for newly identified beneficiaries may be filed at any time during the validity of the labor condition application using photocopies of the same application. Each petition must refer by file number to all previously approved petitions for that labor condition application.</p><p>(<em>4</em>) When petitions have been approved for the total number of workers specified in the labor condition application, substitution of aliens against previously approved openings shall not be made.

For purposes of determining equivalency to a baccalaureate degree in the specialty, three years of specialized training and/or work experience must be demonstrated for each year of college-level training the alien lacks. For equivalence to an advanced (or Masters) degree, the alien must have a baccalaureate degree followed by at least five years of experience in the specialty. If required by a specialty, the alien must hold a Doctorate degree or its foreign equivalent. It must be clearly demonstrated that the alien's training and/or work experience included the theoretical and practical application of specialized knowledge required by the specialty occupation; that the alien's experience was gained while working with peers, supervisors, or subordinates who have a degree or its equivalent in the specialty occupation; and that the alien has recognition of expertise in the specialty evidenced by at least one type of documentation such as:</p><p>(<em>i</em>) Recognition of expertise in the specialty occupation by at least two recognized authorities in the same specialty occupation;</p><p>(<em>ii</em>) Membership in a recognized foreign or United States association or society in the specialty occupation;</p><p>(<em>iii</em>) Published material by or about the alien in professional publications, trade journals, books, or major newspapers;</p><p>(<em>iv</em>) Licensure or registration to practice the specialty occupation in a foreign country; or</p><p>(<em>v</em>) Achievements which a recognized authority has determined to be significant contributions to the field of the specialty occupation.</p><p>(E) <em>Liability for transportation costs.</em> The employer will be liable for the reasonable costs of return transportation of the alien abroad if the alien is dismissed from employment by the employer before the end of the period of authorized admission pursuant to section 214(c)(5) of the Act. If the beneficiary voluntarily terminates his or her employment prior to the expiration of the validity of the petition, the alien has not been dismissed. If the beneficiary believes that the employer has not complied with this provision, the beneficiary shall advise the Service Center which adjudicated the petition in writing. The complaint will be retained in the file relating to the petition. Within the context of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;abroad&rdquo; refers to the alien's last place of foreign residence. This provision applies to any employer whose offer of employment became the basis for an alien obtaining or continuing H-1B status.</p><p>(iv) <em>General documentary requirements for H-1B classification in a specialty occupation.</em> An H-1B petition involving a specialty occupation shall be accompanied by:</p><p>(A) Documentation, certifications, affidavits, declarations, degrees, diplomas, writings, reviews, or any other required evidence sufficient to establish that the beneficiary is qualified to perform services in a specialty occupation as described in paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section and that the services the beneficiary is to perform are in a specialty occupation. The evidence shall conform to the following:</p><p>(<em>1</em>) School records, diplomas, degrees, affidavits, declarations, contracts, and similar documentation submitted must reflect periods of attendance, courses of study, and similar pertinent data, be executed by the person in charge of the records of the educational or other institution, firm, or establishment where education or training was acquired.</p><p>(<em>2</em>) Affidavits or declarations made under penalty of perjury submitted by present or former employers or recognized authorities certifying as to the recognition and expertise of the beneficiary shall specifically describe the beneficiary's recognition and ability in factual terms and must set forth the expertise of the affiant and the manner in which the affiant acquired such information.</p><p>(B) Copies of any written contracts between the petitioner and beneficiary, or a summary of the terms of the oral agreement under which the beneficiary will be employed, if there is no written contract.</p><p>(v) <em>Licensure for H classification</em>&mdash;(A) <em>General.</em> If an occupation requires a state or local license for an individual to fully perform the duties of the occupation, an alien (except an H-1C nurse) seeking H classification in that occupation must have that license prior to approval of the petition to be found qualified to enter the United States and immediately engage in employment in the occupation.</p><p>(B) <em>Temporary licensure.</em> If a temporary license is available and the alien is allowed to perform the duties of the occupation without a permanent license, the director shall examine the nature of the duties, the level at which the duties are performed, the degree of supervision received, and any limitations placed on the alien. If an analysis of the facts demonstrates that the alien under supervision is authorized to fully perform the duties of the occupation, H classification may be granted.</p><p>(C) <em>Duties without licensure.</em> In certain occupations which generally require licensure, a state may allow an individual to fully practice the occupation under the supervision of licensed senior or supervisory personnel in that occupation. In such cases, the director shall examine the nature of the duties and the level at which they are performed. If the facts demonstrate that the alien under supervision could fully perform the duties of the occupation, H classification may be granted.</p><p>(D) <em>H-1C nurses.</em> For purposes of licensure, H-1C nurses must provide the evidence required in paragraph (h)(3)(iii) of this section.</p><p>(E) <em>Limitation on approval of petition.</em> Where licensure is required in any occupation, including registered nursing, the H petition may only be approved for a period of one year or for the period that the temporary license is valid, whichever is longer, unless the alien already has a permanent license to practice the occupation. An alien who is accorded H classification in an occupation which requires licensure may not be granted an extension of stay or accorded a new H classification after the one year unless he or she has obtained a permanent license in the state of intended employment or continues to hold a temporary license valid in the same state for the period of the requested extension.</p><p>(vi) <em>Criteria and documentary requirements for H-1B petitions involving DOD cooperative research and development projects or coproduction projects</em>&mdash;(A) <em>General.</em> (<em>1</em>) For purposes of H-1B classification, services of an exceptional nature relating to DOD cooperative research and development projects or coproduction projects shall be those services which require a baccalaureate or higher degree, or its equivalent, to perform the duties. The existence of this special program does not preclude the DOD from utilizing the regular H-1B provisions provided the required guidelines are met.</p><p>(<em>2</em>) The requirements relating to a labor condition application from the Department of Labor shall not apply to petitions involving DOD cooperative research and development projects or coproduction projects.</p><p>(B) <em>Petitioner requirements.</em> (<em>1</em>) The petition must be accompanied by a verification letter from the DOD project manager for the particular project stating that the alien will be working on a cooperative research and development project or a coproduction project under a reciprocal Government-to-Government agreement administered by DOD. Details about the specific project are not required.</p><p>(<em>2</em>) The petitioner shall provide a general description of the alien's duties on the particular project and indicate the actual dates of the alien's employment on the project.</p><p>(<em>3</em>) The petitioner shall submit a statement indicating the names of aliens currently employed on the project in the United States and their dates of employment. The petitioner shall also indicate the names of aliens whose employment on the project ended within the past year.</p><p>(C) <em>Beneficiary requirement.</em> The petition shall be accompanied by evidence that the beneficiary has a baccalaureate or higher degree or its equivalent in the occupational field in which he or she will be performing services in accordance with paragraph (h)(4)(iii)(C) and/or (h)(4)(iii)(D) of this section.</p><p>(vii) <em>Criteria and documentary requirements for H-1B petitions for aliens of distinguished merit and ability in the field of fashion modeling</em>&mdash;(A) <em>General.</em> Prominence in the field of fashion modeling may be established in the case of an individual fashion model. The work which a prominent alien is coming to perform in the United States must require the services of a prominent alien. A petition for an H-1B alien of distinguished merit and ability in the field of fashion modeling shall be accompanied by:</p><p>(<em>1</em>) Documentation, certifications, affidavits, writings, reviews, or any other required evidence sufficient to establish that the beneficiary is a fashion model of distinguished merit and ability. Affidavits submitted by present or former employers or recognized experts certifying to the recognition and distinguished ability of the beneficiary shall specifically describe the beneficiary's recognition and ability in factual terms and must set forth the expertise of the affiant and the manner in which the affiant acquired such information.</p><p>(<em>2</em>) Copies of any written contracts between the petitioner and beneficiary, or a summary of the terms of the oral agreement under which the beneficiary will be employed, if there is no written contract.</p><p>(B) <em>Petitioner's requirements.</em> To establish that a position requires prominence, the petitioner must establish that the position meets one of the following criteria:</p><p>(<em>1</em>) The services to be performed involve events or productions which have a distinguished reputation;</p><p>(<em>2</em>) The services are to be performed for an organization or establishment that has a distinguished reputation for, or record of, employing prominent persons.</p><p>(C) <em>Beneficiary's requirements.</em> A petitioner may establish that a beneficiary is a fashion model of distinguished merit and ability by the submission of two of the following forms of documentation showing that the alien:</p><p>(<em>1</em>) Has achieved national or international recognition and acclaim for outstanding achievement in his or her field as evidenced by reviews in major newspapers, trade journals, magazines, or other published material;</p><p>(<em>2</em>) Has performed and will perform services as a fashion model for employers with a distinguished reputation;</p><p>(<em>3</em>) Has received recognition for significant achievements from organizations, critics, fashion houses, modeling agencies, or other recognized experts in the field; or</p><p>(<em>4</em>) Commands a high salary or other substantial remuneration for services evidenced by contracts or other reliable evidence.</p><p>(viii) <em>Criteria and documentary requirements for H-1B petitions for physicians</em>&mdash;(A) <em>Beneficiary's requirements.</em> An H-1B petition for a physician shall be accompanied by evidence that the physician:</p><p>(<em>1</em>) Has a license or other authorization required by the state of intended employment to practice medicine, or is exempt by law therefrom, if the physician will perform direct patient care and the state requires the license or authorization, and</p><p>(<em>2</em>) Has a full and unrestricted license to practice medicine in a foreign state or has graduated from a medical school in the United States or in a foreign state.</p><p>(B) <em>Petitioner's requirements.</em> The petitioner must establish that the alien physician:</p><p>(<em>1</em>) Is coming to the United States primarily to teach or conduct research, or both, at or for a public or nonprofit private educational or research institution or agency, and that no patient care will be performed, except that which is incidental to the physician's teaching or research; or</p><p>(<em>2</em>) The alien has passed the Federation Licensing Examination (or an equivalent examination as determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services) or is a graduate of a United States medical school; and</p><p>(<em>i</em>) Has competency in oral and written English which shall be demonstrated by the passage of the English language proficiency test given by the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates; or</p><p>(<em>ii</em>) Is a graduate of a school of medicine accredited by a body or bodies approved for that purpose by the Secretary of Education.</p><p>(C) <em>Exception for physicians of national or international renown.</em> A physician who is a graduate of a medical school in a foreign state and who is of national or international renown in the field of medicine is exempt from the requirements of paragraph (h)(4)(viii)(B) of this section.            </p><p>(5) <em>Petition for alien to perform agricultural labor or services of a temporary or seasonal nature (H-2A)</em>&mdash;(i) <em>Filing a petition</em>&mdash;(A) <em>General.</em> An H-2A petition must be filed on Form I-129. The petition must be filed with a single valid temporary agricultural labor certification. However, if a certification is denied, domestic labor subsequently fails to appear at the worksite, and the Department of Labor denies an appeal under section 216(e)(2) of the Act, the written denial of appeal shall be considered a certification for this purpose if filed with evidence which establishes that qualified domestic labor is unavailable. An H-2A petition may be filed by either the employer listed on the certification, the employer's agent, or the association of United States agricultural producers named as a joint employer on the certification.</p><p>(B) <em>Multiple beneficiaries.</em> The total number of beneficiaries of a petition or series of petitions based on the same certification may not exceed the number of workers indicated on that document. A single petition can include more than one beneficiary if the total number does not exceed the number of positions indicated on the relating certification, and all beneficiaries will obtain a visa at the same consulate or are not required to have a visa and will apply for admission at the same port of entry.</p><p>(C) <em>Unnamed beneficiaries.</em> The sole beneficiary of an H-2A petition must be named in the petition. In a petition for multiple beneficiaries, each must be named unless he or she is not named in the certification and is outside the United States. Unnamed beneficiaries must be shown on the petition by total number.</p><p>(D) <em>Evidence.</em> An H-2A petitioner must show that the proposed employment qualifies as a basis for H-2A status, and that any named beneficiary qualifies for that employment. A petition will be automatically denied if filed without the certification evidence required in paragraph (h)(5)(i)(A) of this section and, for each named beneficiary, the initial evidence required in paragraph (h)(5)(v) of this section.</p><p>(E) <em>Special filing requirements.</em> Where a certification shows joint employers, a petition must be filed with an attachment showing that each employer has agreed to the conditions of H-2A eligibility. A petition filed by an agent must be filed with an attachment in which the employer has authorized the agent to act on its behalf, has assumed full responsibility for all representations made by the agent on its behalf, and has agreed to the conditions of H-2A eligibility.</p><p>(ii) <em>Effect of the labor certification process.</em> The temporary agricultural labor certification process determines whether employment is as an agricultural worker, whether it is open to U.S. workers, if qualified U.S. workers are available, the adverse impact of employment of a qualified alien, and whether employment conditions, including housing, meet applicable requirements. In petition proceedings a petitioner must establish that the employment and beneficiary meet the requirements of paragraph (h)(5) of this section. In a petition filed with a certification denial, the petitioner must also overcome the Department of Labor's findings regarding the availability of qualified domestic labor.</p><p>(iii) <em>Ability and intent to meet a job offer</em>&mdash;(A) <em>Eligibility requirements.</em> An H-2A petitioner must establish that each beneficiary will be employed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the certification, which includes that the principal duties to be performed are those on the certification, with other duties minor and incidental.</p><p>(B) <em>Intent and prior compliance.</em> Requisite intent cannot be established for two years after an employer or joint employer, or a parent, subsidiary or affiliate thereof, is found to have violated section 274(a) of the Act or to have employed an H-2A worker in a position other than that described in the relating petition.</p><p>(C) <em>Initial evidence.</em> Representations required for the purpose of labor certification are initial evidence of intent.</p><p>(iv) <em>Temporary and seasonal employment</em>&mdash;(A) <em>Eligibility requirements.</em> An H-2A petitioner must establish that the employment proposed in the certification is of a temporary or seasonal nature. Employment is of a seasonal nature where it is tied to a certain time of year by an event or pattern, such as a short annual growing cycle or a specific aspect of a longer cycle, and requires labor levels far above those necessary for ongoing operations. Employment is of a temporary nature where the employer's need to fill the position with a temporary worker will, except in extraordinary circumstances, last no longer than one year.</p><p>(B) <em>Effect of Department of Labor findings.</em> In temporary agricultural labor certification proceedings the Department of Labor separately tests whether employment qualifies as temporary or seasonal. Its finding that employment qualifies is normally sufficient for the purpose of an H-2A petition, However, notwithstanding that finding, employment will be found not to be temporary or seasonal where an application for permanent labor certification has been filed for the same alien, or for another alien to be employed in the same position, by the same employer or by its parent, subsidiary or affiliate. This can only be overcome by the petitioner's demonstration that there will be at least a six month interruption of employment in the United States after H-2A status ends. Also, eligibility will not be found, notwithstanding the issuance of a temporary agricultural labor certification, where there is substantial evidence that the employment is not temporary or seasonal.</p><p>(v) <em>The beneficiary's qualifications</em>&mdash;(A) <em>Eligibility requirements.</em> An H-2A petitioner must establish that any named beneficiary met the stated minimum requirements and was fully able to perform the stated duties when the application for certification was filed. It must be established at time of application for an H-2A visa, or for admission if a visa is not required, that any unnamed beneficiary either met these requirements when the certification was applied for or passed any certified aptitude test at any time prior to visa issuance, or prior to admission if a visa is not required.</p><p>(B) <em>Initial evidence of employment/job training.</em> A petition must be filed with evidence that at the required time the beneficiary met the certification's minimum employment and job training requirements. Initial evidence must be in the form of the past employer's detailed statement or actual employment documents, such as company payroll or tax records. Alternately, a petitioner must show that such evidence cannot be obtained, and submit affidavits from people who worked with the beneficiary that demonstrate the claimed employment.</p><p>(C) <em>Initial evidence of education and other training.</em> A petition must be filed with evidence that at the required time each beneficiary met the certification's minimum post-secondary education and other formal training requirements. Initial evidence must be in the form of documents, issued by the relevant institution or organization, that show periods of attendance, majors and degrees or certificates accorded.</p><p>(vi) <em>Petition agreements</em>&mdash;(A) <em>Consent and liabilities.</em> In filing an H-2A petition, a petitioner and each employer consents to allow access to the site where the labor is being performed for the purpose of determining compliance with H-2A requirements. The petitioner further agrees to notify the Service in the manner specified within twenty-four hours if an H-2A worker absconds or if the authorized employment ends more than five days before the relating certification document expires, and to pay liquidated damages of ten dollars for each instance where it cannot demonstrate compliance with this notification requirement. The petitioner also agrees to pay liquidated damages of two hundred dollars for each instance where is cannot demonstrate that its H-2A worker either departed the United States or obtained authorized status based on another petition during the period of admission or within five days of early termination, whichever comes first.</p><p>(B) <em>Process.</em> Where evidence indicates noncompliance under paragraph (h)(5)(vi)(A) of this section, the petitioner shall be given written notice and given ten days to reply. If it does not demonstrate compliance, it shall be given written notice of the assessment of liquidated damages.</p><p>(C) <em>Failure to pay liquidated damages.</em> If liquidated damages are not paid within ten days of assessment, an H-2A petition may not be processed for that petitioner or any joint employer shown on the petition until such damages are paid.            </p><p>(vii) <em>Validity.</em> An approved H-2A petition is valid through the expiration of the relating certification for the purpose of allowing a beneficiary to seek issuance of an H-2A nonimmigrant visa, admission or an extension of stay for the purpose of engaging in the specific certified employment.</p><p>(viii) <em>Admission</em>&mdash;(A) <em>Effect of violation of status.</em> An alien may not be accorded H-2A status who the Service finds to have violated the conditions of H-2A status within the prior five years. H-2A status is violated by remaining beyond the specific period of authorized stay or by engaging in unauthorized employment.</p><p>(B) <em>Period of admission.</em> Notwithstanding paragraph (h)(13) of this section, and except as provided in paragraph (h)(5)(ix)(C) of this section, an alien admissible as an H-2A shall be admitted for the period of the approved petition plus a period of up to one week before the beginning of the approved period for the purpose of travel to the worksite, and a period following the expiration of the H-2A petition equal to the validity period of the petition, but not more than ten days, for the purpose of departure or extension based on a subsequent offer of employment. However, this extended admission period does not affect the beneficiary's employment authorization. Such authorization only applies to the specific employment indicated in the relating petition, for the specific period of time indicated.</p><p>(C) <em>Limits on an individual's stay.</em> An alien's stay as an H-2A is limited by the term of an approved petition. An alien may remain longer to engage in other qualifying temporary agricultural employment by obtaining an extension of stay. However, an individual who has held H-2A status for a total of three years may not again be granted H-2A status, or other nonimmigrant status based on agricultural activities, until such time as he or she remains outside the United States for an uninterrupted period of six months. An absence can interrupt the accumulation of time spent as an H-2A. If the accumulated stay is eighteen months or less, an absence is interruptive if it lasts for at least three months. If more than eighteen months stay has been accumulated, an absence is interruptive if it lasts for at least one-sixth the accumulated stay. Eligibility under this subparagraph will be determined in admission, change of status or extension proceedings. An alien found eligible for a shorter period of -H-2A status than that indicated by the petition due to the application of this subparagraph shall only be admitted for that abbreviated period.</p><p>(ix) <em>Substitution of beneficiaries after admission.</em> An H-2A petition may be filed to replace H-2A workers whose employment was terminated early. The petition must be filed with a copy of the certification document, a copy of the approval notice covering the workers for which replacements are sought, and other evidence required by paragraph (h)(5)(i)(D) of this section. It must also be filed with a statement giving each terminated worker's name, date and country of birth, termination date, and evidence the worker has departed the United States. A petition for a replacement may not be approved where the requirements of paragraph (h)(5)(vi) of this section have not been met. A petition for replacements does not constitute the notice that an H-2A worker has absconded or has ended authorized employment more than five days before the relating certification expires.</p><p>(x) <em>Extensions without labor certification.</em> A single H-2A petition may be extended without a certification if it is based on approval of the alien's application for extension of stay for a continuation of the employment authorized by the approval of a previous H-2A petition filed with a certification (but not a certification extension granted under 20 CFR 655.106(c)(3)), and the proposed continuation of employment will last no longer than the previously authorized employment and also will not last longer than two weeks.</p><p>(6) <em>Petition for alien to perform temporary nonagricultural services or labor (H-2B)</em>&mdash;(i) <em>General.</em> An H-2B nonagricultural temporary worker is an alien who is coming temporarily to the United States to perform temporary services or labor, is not displacing United States workers capable of performing such services or labor, and whose employment is not adversely affecting the wages and working conditions of United States workers.</p><p>(ii) <em>Temporary services or labor</em>&mdash;(A) <em>Definition.</em> Temporary services or labor under the H-2B classification refers to any job in which the petitioner's need for the duties to be performed by the employee(s) is temporary, whether or not the underlying job can be described as permanent or temporary.</p><p>(B) <em>Nature of petitioner's need.</em> As a general rule, the period of the petitioner's need must be a year or less, although there may be extraordinary circumstances where the temporary services or labor might last longer than one year. The petitioner's need for the services or labor shall be a one-time occurrence, a seasonal need, a peakload need, or an intermittent need:</p><p>(<em>1</em>) <em>One-time occurence.</em> The petitioner must establish that it has not employed workers to perform the services or labor in the past and that it will not need workers to perform the services or labor in the future, or that it has an employment situation that is otherwise permanent, but a temporary event of short duration has created the need for a temporary worker.</p><p>(<em>2</em>) <em>Seasonal need.</em> The petitioner must establish that the services or labor is traditionally tied to a season of the year by an event or pattern and is of a recurring nature. The petitioner shall specify the period(s) of time during each year in which it does not need the services or labor. The employment is not seasonal if the period during which the services or labor is not needed is unpredictable or subject to change or is considered a vacation period for the petitioner's permanent employees.</p><p>(<em>3</em>) <em>Peakload need.</em> The petitoner must establish that it regularly employs permanent workers to perform the services or labor at the place of employment and that it needs to supplement its permanent staff at the place of employment on a temporary basis due to a seasonal or short-term demand and that the temporary additions to staff will not become a part of the petitioner's regular operation.</p><p>(<em>4</em>) <em>Intermittent need.</em> The petitioner must establish that it has not employed permanent or full-time workers to perform the services or labor, but occasionally or intermittently needs temporary workers to perform services or labor for short periods.</p><p>(iii) <em>Procedures.</em> (A) Prior to filing a petition with the director to classify an alien as an H-2B worker, the petitioner shall apply for a temporary labor certification with the Secretary of Labor for all areas of the United States, except the Territory of Guam. In the Territory of Guam, the petitioning employer shall apply for a temporary labor certification with the Governor of Guam. The labor certification shall be advice to the director on whether or not United States workers capable of performing the temporary services or labor are available and whether or not the alien's employment will adversely affect the wages and working conditions of similarly employed United States workers.</p><p>(B) An H-2B petitioner shall be a United States employer, a United States agent, or a foreign employer filing through a United States agent. For purposes of paragraph (h) of this section, a foreign employer is any employer who is not amendable to service of process in the United States. A foreign employer may not directly petition for an H-2B nonimmigrant but must use the services of a United States agent to file a petition for an H-2B nonimmigrant. A United States agent petitioning on behalf of a foreign employer must be authorized to file the petition, and to accept service of process in the United States in proceedings under section 274A of the Act, on behalf of the employer. The petitioning employer shall consider available United States workers for the temporary services or labor, and shall offer terms and conditions of employment which are consistent with the nature of the occupation, activity, and industry in the United States.</p><p>(C) The petitioner may not file an H-2B petition unless the United States petitioner has applied for a labor certification with the Secretary of Labor or the Governor of Guam within the time limits prescribed or accepted by each, and has obtained a labor certification determination as required by paragraph (h)(6)(iv) or (h)(6)(v) of this section.            </p><p>(D) The Secretary of Labor and the Governor of Guam shall separately establish procedures for administering the temporary labor certification program under his or her jurisdiction.</p><p>(E) After obtaining a determination from the Secretary of Labor or the Governor of Guam, as appropriate, the petitioner shall file a petition on I-129, accompanied by the labor certification determination and supporting documents, with the director having jurisdiction in the area of intended employment.</p><p>(iv) <em>Labor certifications, except Guam</em>&mdash;(A) <em>Secretary of Labor's determination.</em> An H-2B petition for temporary employment in the United States, except for temporary employment on Guam, shall be accompanied by a labor certification determination that is either:</p><p>(<em>1</em>) A certification from the Secretary of Labor stating that qualified workers in the United States are not available and that the alien's employment will not adversely affect wages and working conditions of similary employed United States workers; or</p><p>(<em>2</em>) A notice detailing the reasons why such certification cannot be made. Such notice shall address the availability of U.S. workers in the occupation and the prevailing wages and working conditions of U.S. workers in the occupation.</p><p>(B) <em>Validity of the labor certification.</em> The Secretary of Labor may issue a temporary labor certification for a period of up to one year.</p><p>(C) <em>U.S. Virgin Islands.</em> Temporary labor certifications filed under section 101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(b) of the Act for employment in the United States Virgin Islands may be approved only for entertainers and athletes and only for periods not to exceed 45 days.</p><p>(D) <em>Attachment to petition.</em> If the petitioner receives a notice from the Secretary of Labor that certification cannot be made, a petition containing countervailing evidence may be filed with the director. The evidence must show that qualified workers in the United States are not available, and that the terms and conditions of employment are consistent with the nature of the occupation, activity, and industry in the United States. All such evidence submitted will be considered in adjudicating the petition.</p><p>(E) <em>Countervailing evidence.</em> The countervailing evidence presented by the petitioner shall be in writing and shall address availability of U.S. workers, the prevailing wage rate for the occupation of the United States, and each of the reasons why the Secretary of Labor could not grant a labor certification. The petitioner may also submit other appropriate information in support of the petition. The director, at his or her discretion, may require additional supporting evidence.</p><p>(v) <em>Labor certification for Guam</em>&mdash;(A) <em>Governor of Guam's determination.</em> An H-2B petition for temporary employment on Guam shall be accompanied by a labor certification determination that is either:</p><p>(<em>1</em>) A certification from the Governor of Guam stating that qualified workers in the United States are not available to perform the required services, and that the alien's employment will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of United States resident workers who are similarly employed on Guam; or</p><p>(<em>2</em>) A notice detailing the reasons why such certification cannot be made. Such notice shall address the availability of U.S. workers in the occupation and/or the prevailing wages and working conditions of U.S. workers in the occupation.</p><p>(B) <em>Validity of labor certification.</em> The Governor of Guam may issue a temporary labor certification for a period up to one year.</p><p>(C) <em>Attachments to petition.</em> If the employer receives a notice from the Governor of Guam that certification cannot be made, a petition containing countervailing evidence may be filed with the director. The evidence must show that qualified workers in the United States are not available, and that the terms and conditions of employment are consistent with the nature of the occupation, activity, and industry in the United States. All such evidence submitted will be considered in adjudicating the petition.</p><p>(D) <em>Countervailing evidence.</em> The countervailing evidence presented by the petitioner shall be in writing and shall address availability of United States workers, the prevailing wage rate, and each of the reasons why the Governor of Guam could not make the required certification. The petitioner may also provide any other appropriate information in support of the petition. The director, at his or her discretion, may require additional supporting evidence.</p><p>(E) <em>Criteria for Guam labor certifications.</em> The Governor of Guam shall, in consultation with the Service, establish systematic methods for determining the prevailing wage rates and working conditions for individual occupations on Guam and for making determinations as to availability of qualified United States residents.</p><p>(<em>1</em>) <em>Prevailing wage and working conditions.</em> The system to determine wages and working conditions must provide for consideration of wage rates and employment conditions for occupations in both the private and public sectors, in Guam and/or in the United States (as defined in section 101(a)(38) of the Act), and may not consider wages and working conditions outside of the United States. If the system includes utilitzation of advisory opinions and consultations, the opinions must be provided by officially sanctioned groups which reflect a balance of the interests of the private and public sectors, government, unions and management.</p><p>(<em>2</em>) <em>Availability of United States workers.</em> The system for determining availability of qualified United States workers must require the prospective employer to:</p><p>(<em>i</em>) Advertise the availability of the position for a minimum of three consecutive days in the newspaper with the largest daily circulation on Guam;</p><p>(<em>ii</em>) Place a job offer with an appropriate agency of the Territorial Government which operates as a job referral service at least 30 days in advance of the need for the services to commence, except that for applications from the armed forces of the United States and those in the entertainment industry, the 30-day period may be reduced by the Governor to 10 days;</p><p>(<em>iii</em>) Conduct appropriate recruitment in other areas of the United and its territories if sufficient qualified United States construction workers are not available on Guam to fill a job. The Governor of Guam may require a job order to be placed more than 30 days in advance of need to accommodate such recruitment;</p><p>(<em>iv</em>) Report to the appropriate agency the names of all United States resident workers who applied for the position, indicating those hired and the job-related reasons for not hiring;</p><p>(<em>v</em>) Offer all special considerations, such as housing and transportation expenses, to all United States resident workers who applied for the position, indicating those hired and the job-related reasons for not hiring;</p><p>(<em>vi</em>) Meet the prevailing wage rates and working conditions determined under the wages and working conditions system by the Governor; and</p><p>(<em>vii</em>) Agree to meet all Federal and Territorial requirements relating to employment, such as nondiscrimination, occupational safety, and minimum wage requirements.</p><p>(F) <em>Approval and publication of employment systems on Guam&mdash;(1</em>) <em>Systems.</em> The Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization must approve the system to determine prevailing wages and working conditions and the system to determine availability of United States resident workers and any future modifications of the systems prior to implementation. If the Commissioner, in consultation with the Secretary of Labor, finds that the systems or modified systems meet the requirements of this section, the Commissioner shall publish them as a notice in the <em>Federal Register</em> and the Governor shall publish them as a public record in Guam.</p><p>(<em>2</em>) <em>Approval of construction wage rates.</em> The Commissioner must approve specific wage data and rates used for construction occupations on Guam prior to implementation of new rates. The Governor shall submit new wage survey data and proposed rates to the Commissioner for approval at least eight weeks before authority to use existing rates expires. Surveys shall be conducted at least every two years, unless the Commissioner prescribes a lesser period.</p><p>(G) <em>Reporting.</em> The Governor shall provide the Commissioner statistical data on temporary labor certification workload and determinations. This information shall be submitted quarterly no later than 30 days after the quarter ends.</p><p>(H) <em>Invalidation of temporary labor certification issued by the Governor of Guam</em>&mdash;(<em>1</em>) <em>General.</em> A temporary labor certification issued by the Governor of Guam may be invalidated by a director if it is determined by the director or a court of law that the certification request involved fraud or willful misrepresentation. A temporary labor certification may also be invalidated if the director determines that the certification involved gross error.</p><p>(<em>2</em>) <em>Notice of intent to invalidate.</em> If the director intends to invalidate a temporary labor certification, a notice of intent shall be served upon the employer, detailing the reasons for the intended invalidation. The employer shall have 30 days in which to file a written response in rebuttal to the notice of intent. The director shall consider all evidence submitted upon rebuttal in reaching a decision.</p><p>(<em>3</em>) <em>Appeal of invalidation.</em> An employer may appeal the invalidation of a temporary labor certification in accordance with part 103 of this chapter.</p><p>(vi) <em>Evidence for H-2B petitions.</em> An H-2B petition shall be accompanied by:</p><p>(A) <em>Labor certification or notice.</em> A temporary labor certification or a notice that certification cannot be made, issued by the Secretary of Labor or the Governor of Guam, as appropriate;</p><p>(B) <em>Countervailing evidence.</em> Evidence to rebut the Secretary of Labor's or the Governor of Guam's notice that certification cannot be made, if appropriate;</p><p>(C) <em>Alien's qualifications.</em> Documentation that the alien qualifies for the job offer as specified in the application for labor certification, except in petitions where the labor certification application requires no education, training, experience, or special requirements of the beneficiary; and</p><p>(D) <em>Statement of need.</em> A statement describing in detail the temporary situation or conditions which make it necessary to bring the alien to the United States and whether the need is a one-time occurrence, seasonal, peakload, or intermittent. If the need is seasonal, peakload, or intermittent, the statement shall indicate whether the situation or conditions are expected to be recurrent.</p><p>(E) <em>Liability for transportation costs.</em> The employer will be liable for the reasonable costs of return transportation of the alien abroad, if the alien is dismissed from employment for any reason by the employer before the end of the period of authorized admission pursuant to section 214(c)(5) of the Act. If the beneficiary voluntarily terminates his or her employment prior to the expiration of the validity of the petition, the alien has not been dismissed. If the beneficiary believes that the employer has not complied with this provision, the beneficiary shall advise the Service Center which adjudicated the petition in writing. The complaint will be retained in the file relating to the petition. Within the context of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;abroad&rdquo; means the alien's last place of foreign residence. This provision applies to any employer whose offer of employment became the basis for the alien obtaining or continuing H-2B status.</p><p>(vii) <em>Traded professional H-2B athletes.</em> In the case of a professional H-2B athlete who is traded from one organization or another organization, employment authorization for the player will automatically continue for a period of 30 days after the player's acquisition by the new organization, within which time the new organization is expected to file a new Form I-129 for H-2B nonimmigrant classification. If a new Form I-129 is not filed within 30 days, employment authorization will cease. If a new Form I-129 is filed within 30 days, the professional athlete shall be deemed to be in valid H-2B status, and employment shall continue to be authorized, until the petition is adjudicated. If the new petition is denied, employment authorization will cease.</p><p>(7) <em>Petition for alien trainee or participant in a special education exchange visitor program (H-3)</em>&mdash;(i) <em>Alien trainee.</em> The H-3 trainee is a nonimmigrant who seeks to enter the United States at the invitation of an organization or individual for the purpose of receiving training in any field of endeavor, such as agriculture, commerce, communications, finance, government, transportation, or the professions, as well as training in a purely industrial establishment. This category shall not apply to physicians, who are statutorily ineligible to use H-3 classification in order to receive any type of graduate medical education or training.</p><p>(A) <em>Externs.</em> A hospital approved by the American Medical Association or the American Osteopathic Association for either an internship or residency program may petition to classify as an H-3 trainee a medical student attending a medical school abroad, if the alien will engage in employment as an extern during his/her medical school vacation.</p><p>(B) <em>Nurses.</em> A petitioner may seek H-3 classification for a nurse who is not H-1 if it can be established that there is a genuine need for the nurse to receive a brief period of training that is unavailable in the alien's native country and such training is designed to benefit the nurse and the overseas employer upon the nurse's return to the country of origin, if:</p><p>(<em>1</em>) The beneficiary has obtained a full and unrestricted license to practice professional nursing in the country where the beneficiary obtained a nursing education, or such education was obtained in the United States or Canada; and</p><p>(<em>2</em>) The petitioner provides a statement certifying that the beneficiary is fully qualified under the laws governing the place where the training will be received to engage in such training, and that under those laws the petitioner is authorized to give the beneficiary the desired training.</p><p>(ii) <em>Evidence required for petition involving alien trainee</em>&mdash;(A) <em>Conditions.</em> The petitioner is required to demonstrate that:</p><p>(<em>1</em>) The proposed training is not available in the alien's own country;</p><p>(<em>2</em>) The beneficiary will not be placed in a position which is in the normal operation of the business and in which citizens and resident workers are regularly employed;</p><p>(<em>3</em>) The beneficiary will not engage in productive employment unless such employment is incidental and necessary to the training; and</p><p>(<em>4</em>) The training will benefit the beneficiary in pursuing a career outside the United States.</p><p>(B) <em>Description of training program.</em> Each petition for a trainee must include a statement which:</p><p>(<em>1</em>) Describes the type of training and supervision to be given, and the structure of the training program;</p><p>(<em>2</em>) Sets forth the proportion of time that will be devoted to productive employment;</p><p>(<em>3</em>) Shows the number of hours that will be spent, respectively, in classroom instruction and in on-the-job training;</p><p>(<em>4</em>) Describes the career abroad for which the training will prepare the alien;</p><p>(<em>5</em>) Indicates the reasons why such training cannot be obtained in the alien's country and why it is necessary for the alien to be trained in the United States; and</p><p>(<em>6</em>) Indicates the source of any remuneration received by the trainee and any benefit which will accrue to the petitioner for providing the training.</p><p>(iii) <em>Restrictions on training program for alien trainee.</em> A training program may not be approved which:</p><p>(A) Deals in generalities with no fixed schedule, objectives, or means of evaluation;</p><p>(B) Is incompatible with the nature of the petitioner's business or enterprise;</p><p>(C) Is on behalf of a beneficiary who already possesses substantial training and expertise in the proposed field of training;</p><p>(D) Is in a field in which it is unlikely that the knowledge or skill will be used outside the United States;</p><p>(E) Will result in productive employment beyond that which is incidental and necessary to the training;</p><p>(F) Is designed to recruit and train aliens for the ultimate staffing of domestic operations in the United States;</p><p>(G) Does not establish that the petitioner has the physical plant and sufficiently trained manpower to provide the training specified; or</p><p>(H) Is designed to extend the total allowable period of practical training previously authorized a nonimmigrant student.</p><p>(iv) <em>Petition for participant in a special education exchange visitor program</em>&mdash;(A) <em>General Requirements.</em> (<em>1</em>) The H-3 participant in a special education training program must be coming to the United States to participate in a structured program which provides for practical training and experience in the education of children with physical, mental, or emotional disabilities.</p><p>(<em>2</em>) The petition must be filed by a facility which has professionally trained staff and a structured program for providing education to children with disabilities, and for providing training and hands-on experience to participants in the special education exchange visitor program.</p><p>(<em>3</em>) The requirements in this section for alien trainees shall not apply to petitions for participants in a special education exchange visitor program.</p><p>(B) <em>Evidence.</em> An H-3 petition for a participant in a special education exchange visitor program shall be accompanied by:</p><p>(<em>1</em>) A description of the training program and the facility's professional staff and details of the alien's participation in the training program (any custodial care of children must be incidental to the training), and</p><p>(<em>2</em>) Evidence that the alien participant is nearing completion of a baccalaureate or higher degree in special education, or already holds such a degree, or has extensive prior training and experience in teaching children with physical, mental, or emotional disabilities.</p><p>(8) <em>Numerical limits</em>&mdash;(i) <em>Limits on affected categories.</em> During each fiscal year, the total number of aliens who can be provided nonimmigrant classification is limited as follows:</p><p>(A) Aliens classified as H-1B nonimmigrants, excluding those involved in Department of Defense research and development projects or coproduction projects, may not exceed the limits identified in section 214(g)(1)(A) of the Act.</p><p>(B) Aliens classified as H-1B nonimmigrants to work for DOD research and development projects or coproduction projects may not exceed 100 at any time.</p><p>(C) Aliens classified as H-2B nonimmigrants may not exceed 66,000.</p><p>(D) Aliens classified as H-3 nonimmigrant participants in a special education exchange visitor program may not exceed 50.</p><p>(E) Aliens classified as H-1C nonimmigrants may not exceed 500 in a fiscal year.</p><p>(ii) <em>Procedures.</em> (A) Each alien issued a visa or otherwise provided nonimmigrant status under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b), 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c), or 101(a)(15)(H)(ii) of the Act shall be counted for purposes of the numerical limit. Requests for petition extension or extension of an alien's stay shall not be counted for the purpose of the numerical limit. The spouse and children of principal aliens classified as H-4 nonimmigrants shall not be counted against the numerical limit.</p><p>(B) When calculating the numerical limitations or the number of exemptions under section 214(g)(5)(C) of the Act for a given fiscal year, USCIS will make numbers available to petitions in the order in which the petitions are filed. USCIS will make projections of the number of petitions necessary to achieve the numerical limit of approvals, taking into account historical data related to approvals, denials, revocations, and other relevant factors. USCIS will monitor the number of petitions (including the number of beneficiaries requested when necessary) received and will notify the public of the date that USCIS has received the necessary number of petitions (the &ldquo;final receipt date&rdquo;). The day the news is published will not control the final receipt date. When necessary to ensure the fair and orderly allocation of numbers in a particular classification subject to a numerical limitation or the exemption under section 214(g)(5)(C) of the Act, USCIS may randomly select from among the petitions received on the final receipt date the remaining number of petitions deemed necessary to generate the numerical limit of approvals. This random selection will be made via computer-generated selection as validated by the Office of Immigration Statistics. Petitions subject to a numerical limitation not randomly selected or that were received after the final receipt date will be rejected. Petitions filed on behalf of aliens otherwise eligible for the exemption under section 214(g)(5)(C) of the Act not randomly selected or that were received after the final receipt date will be rejected if the numerical limitation under 214(g)(1) of the Act has been reached for that fiscal year. Petitions indicating that they are exempt from the numerical limitation but that are determined by USCIS after the final receipt date to be subject to the numerical limit will be denied and filing fees will not be returned or refunded. If the final receipt date is any of the first five business days on which petitions subject to the applicable numerical limit may be received (<em>i.e.</em>, if the numerical limit is reached on any one of the first five business days that filings can be made), USCIS will randomly apply all of the numbers among the petitions received on any of those five business days, conducting the random selection among the petitions subject to the exemption under section 214(g)(5)(C) of the Act first.</p><p>(C) When an approved petition is not used because the beneficiary(ies) does not apply for admission to the United States, the petitioner shall notify the Service Center Director who approved the petition that the number(s) has not been used. The petition shall be revoked pursuant to paragraph (h)(11)(ii) of this section and USCIS will take into account the unused number during the appropriate fiscal year.</p><p>(D) If the total numbers available in a fiscal year are used, new petitions and the accompanying fee shall be rejected and returned with a notice that numbers are unavailable for the particular nonimmigrant classification until the beginning of the next fiscal year. Petitions received after the total numbers available in a fiscal year are used stating that the alien beneficiaries are exempt from the numerical limitation will be denied and filing fees will not be returned or refunded if USCIS later determines that such beneficiaries are subject to the numerical limitation.</p><p>(E) The 500 H-1C nonimmigrant visas issued each fiscal year shall be allocated in the following manner:</p><p>(<em>1</em>) For each fiscal year, the number of visas issued to the states of California, Florida, Illinois, Michigan, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Texas shall not exceed 50 each (except as provided for in paragraph (h)(8)(ii)(F)(<em>3</em>) of this section).</p><p>(<em>2</em>) For each fiscal year, the number of visas issued to the states not listed in paragraph (h)(8)(ii)(F)(<em>1</em>) of this section shall not exceed 25 each (except as provided for in paragraph (h)(8)(ii)(F)(<em>3</em>) of this section).</p><p>(<em>3</em>) If the total number of visas available during the first three quarters of a fiscal year exceeds the number of approvable H-1C petitions during those quarters, visas may be issued during the last quarter of the fiscal year to nurses who will be working in a state whose cap has already been reached for that fiscal year.</p><p>(<em>4</em>) When an approved H-1C petition is not used because the alien(s) does not obtain H-1C classification, e.g., the alien is never admitted to the United States, or the alien never worked for the facility, the facility must notify the Service according to the instructions contained in paragraph (h)(11)(ii) of this section. The Service will subtract H-1C petitions approved in the current fiscal year that are later revoked from the total count of approved H-1C petitions, provided that the alien never commenced employment with the facility.</p><p>(<em>5</em>) If the number of alien nurses included in an H-1C petition exceeds the number available for the remainder of a fiscal year, the Service shall approve the petition for the beneficiaries to the allowable amount in the order that they are listed on the petition. The remaining beneficiaries will be considered for approval in the subsequent fiscal year.</p><p>(<em>6</em>) Once the 500 cap has been reached, the Service will reject any new petitions subsequently filed requesting a work start date prior to the first day of the next fiscal year.</p><p>(9) <em>Approval and validity of petition</em>&mdash;(i) <em>Approval.</em> The director shall consider all the evidence submitted and such other evidence as he or she may independently require to assist his or her adjudication. The director shall notify the petitioner of the approval of the petition on Form I-797, Notice of Action.

The beneficiary may not work except during the validity period of the petition.</p><p>(B) When an alien in an H classification has spent the maximum allowable period of stay in the United States, a new petition under sections 101(a)(15) (H) or (L) of the Act may not be approved unless that alien has resided and been physically present outside the United States, except for brief trips for business or pleasure, for the time limit imposed on the particular H classification. Brief trips to the United States for business or pleasure during the required time abroad are not interruptive, but do not count towards fulfillment of the required time abroad. The petitioner shall provide information about the alien's employment, place of residence, and the dates and purposes of any trips to the United States during the period that the alien was required to spend time abroad.</p><p>(ii) <em>H-1C limitation on admission.</em> The maximum period of admission for an H-1C nonimmigrant alien is 3 years. The maximum period of admission for an H-1C alien begins on the date the H-1C alien is admitted to the United and ends on the third anniversary of the alien's admission date. Periods of time spent out of the United States for business or personal reasons during the validity period of the H-1C petition count towards the alien's maximum period of admission. When an H-1C alien has reached the 3-year maximum period of admission, the H-1C alien is no longer eligible for admission to the United States as an H-1C nonimmigrant alien.</p><p>(iii) <em>H-1B limitation on admission.</em> (A) <em>Alien in a specialty occupation or an alien of distinguished merit and ability in the field of fashion modeling.</em> An H-1B alien in a specialty occupation or an alien of distinguished merit and ability who has spent six years in the United States under section 101(a)(15)(H) and/or (L) of the Act may not seek extension, change status, or be readmitted to the United States under section 101(a)(15) (H) or (L) of the Act unless the alien has resided and been physically present outside the United States, except for brief trips for business or pleasure, for the immediate prior year.</p><p>(B) <em>Alien involved in a DOD research and development or coproduction project.</em> An H-1B alien involved in a DOD research and development or coproduction project who has spent 10 years in the United States under section 101(a)(15) (H) and/or (L) of the Act may not seek extension, change status, or be readmitted to the United States under section 101(a)(15) (H) or (L) of the Act to perform services involving a DOD research and development project or coproduction project. A new petition or change of status under section 101(a)(15) (H) or (L) of the Act may not be approved for such an alien unless the alien has resided and been physically present outside the United States, except for brief trips for business or pleasure, for the immediate prior year.</p><p>(iv) <em>H-2B and H-3 limitation on admission.</em> An H-2B alien who has spent 3 years in the United States under section 101(a)(15)(H) and/or (L) of the Act; an H-3 alien participant in a special education program who has spent 18 months in the United States under section 101(a)(15)(H) and/or (L) of the Act; and an H-3 alien trainee who has spent 24 months in the United States under section 101(a)(15)(H) and/or (L) of the Act may not seek extension, change status, or be readmitted to the United States under section 101(a)(15)(H) and/or (L) of the Act unless the alien has resided and been physically present outside the United States for the immediate prior 6 months.</p><p>(v) <em>Exceptions.</em> The limitations in paragraph (h)(13)(iii) through (h)(13)(iv) of this section shall not apply to H-1B, H-2B, and H-3 aliens who did not reside continually in the United States and whose employment in the United States was seasonal or intermittent or was for an aggregate of six months or less per year. In addition, the limitations shall not apply to aliens who reside abroad and regularly commute to the United States to engage in part-time employment. To qualify for this exception, the petitioner and the alien must provide clear and convincing proof that the alien qualifies for such an exception. Such proof shall consist of evidence such as arrival and departure records, copies of tax returns, and records of employment abroad.</p><p>(14) <em>Extension of visa petition validity.</em> The petitioner shall file a request for a petition extension on Form I-129 to extend the validity of the original petition under section 101(a)(15)(H) of the Act. Supporting evidence is not required unless requested by the director. A request for a petition extension may be filed only if the validity of the original petition has not expired.</p><p>(15) <em>Extension of stay</em>&mdash;(i) <em>General.</em> The petitioner shall apply for extension of an alien's stay in the United States by filing a petition extension on Form I-129 accompanied by the documents described for the particular classification in paragraph (h)(15)(ii) of this section. The petitioner must also request a petition extension. The dates of extension shall be the same for the petition and the beneficiary's extension of stay. The beneficiary must be physically present in the United States at the time of the filing of the extension of stay. Even though the requests to extend the petition and the alien's stay are combined on the petition, the director shall make a separate determination on each. If the alien is required to leave the United States for business or personal reasons while the extension requests are pending, the petitioner may request the director to cable notification of approval of the petition extension to the consular office abroad where the alien will apply for a visa. When the total period of stay in an H classification has been reached, no further extensions may be granted.</p><p>(ii) <em>Extension periods</em>&mdash;(A) <em>H-1C extension of stay.</em> The maximum period of admission for an H-1C alien is 3 years. An H-1C alien who was initially admitted to the United States for less than 3 years may receive an extension of stay up to the third anniversary date of his or her initial admission. An H-1C nonimmigrant may not receive an extension of stay beyond the third anniversary date of his or her initial admission to the United States.</p><p>(B) <em>H-1B extension of stay</em>&mdash;(<em>1</em>) <em>Alien in a specialty occupation or an alien of distinguished merit and ability in the field of fashion modeling.</em> An extension of stay may be authorized for a period of up to three years for a beneficiary of an H-1B petition in a specialty occupation or an alien of distinguished merit and ability. The alien's total period of stay may not exceed six years. The request for extension must be accompanied by either a new or a photocopy of the prior certification from the Department of Labor that the petitioner continues to have on file a labor condition application valid for the period of time requested for the occupation.</p><p>(<em>2</em>) <em>Alien in a DOD research and development or coproduction project.</em> An extension of stay may be authorized for a period up to five years for the beneficiary of an H-1B petition involving a DOD research and development project or coproduction project. The total period of stay may not exceed 10 years.</p><p>(C) <em>H-2A or H-2B extension of stay.</em> An extension of stay for the beneficiary of an H-2A or H-2B petition may be authorized for the validity of the labor certification or for a period of up to one year, except as provided for in paragraph (h)(5)(x) of this section. The alien's total period of stay as an H-2A or H-2B worker may not exceed three years, except that in the Virgin Islands, the alien's total period of stay may not exceed 45 days.</p><p>(D) <em>H-3 extension of stay.</em> An extension of stay may be authorized for the length of the training program for a total period of stay as an H-3 trainee not to exceed two years, or for a total period of stay as a participant in a special education training program not to exceed 18 months.</p><p>(16) <em>Effect of approval of a permanent labor certification or filing of a preference petition on H classification</em>&mdash;(i) <em>H-1B or H-1C classification.</em> The approval of a permanent labor certification or the filing of a preference petition for an alien shall not be a basis for denying an H-1C or H-1B petition or a request to extend such a petition, or the alien's admission, change of status, or extension of stay. The alien may legitimately come to the United States for a temporary period as an H-1C or H-1B nonimmigrant and depart voluntarily at the end of his or her authorized stay and, at the same time, lawfully seek to become a permanent resident of the United States.</p><p>(ii) <em>H-2A, H-2B, and H-3 classification.</em> The approval of a permanent labor certification, or the filing of a preference petition for an alien currently employed by or in a training position with the same petitioner, shall be a reason, by itself, to deny the alien's extension of stay.</p><p>(17) <em>Effect of a strike</em>&mdash;(i) If the Secretary of Labor certifies to the Commissioner that a strike or other labor dispute involving a work stoppage of workers is in progress in the occupation and at the place where the beneficiary is to be employed or trained, and that the employment of training of the beneficiary would adversely affect the wages and working conditions of U.S. citizens and lawful resident workers:            </p><p>(A) A petition to classify an alien as a nonimmigrant as defined in section 101(a)(15)(H) of the Act shall be denied.</p><p>(B) If a petition has already been approved, but the alien has not yet entered the United States, or has entered the United States but has not commenced the employment, the approval of the petition is automatically suspended, and the application for admission on the basis of the petition shall be denied.</p><p>(ii) If there is a strike or other labor dispute involving a work stoppage of workers in progress, but such strike or other labor dispute is not certified under paragraph (h)(17)(i), the Commissioner shall not deny a petition or suspend an approved petition.</p><p>(iii) If the alien has already commenced employment in the United States under an approved petition and is participating in a strike or other labor dispute involving a work stoppage of workers, whether or not such strike or other labor dispute has been certified by the Department of Labor, the alien shall not be deemed to be failing to maintain his or her status solely on account of past, present, or future participation in a strike or other labor dispute involving a work stoppage of workers, but is subject to the following terms and conditions:</p><p>(A) The alien shall remain subject to all applicable provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act, and regulations promulgated in the same manner as all other H nonimmigrants;</p><p>(B) The status and authorized period of stay of such an alien is not modified or extended in any way by virtue of his or her participation in a strike or other labor dispute involving a work stoppage of workers; and</p><p>(C) Although participation by an H nonimmigrant alien in a strike or other labor dispute involving a work stoppage of workers will not constitute a ground for deportation, any alien who violates his or her status or who remains in the United States after his or her authorized period of stay has expired will be subject to deportation.</p><p>(18) <em>Use of approval notice, Form I-797.</em> The Service shall notify the petitioner on Form I-797 whenever a visa petition, an extension of a visa petition, or an alien's extension of stay is approved under the H classification. The beneficiary of an H petition who does not require a nonimmigrant visa may present a copy of the approval notice at a port of entry to facilitate entry into the United States. A beneficiary who is required to present a visa for admission and whose visa will have expired before the date of his or her intended return may use a copy of Form I-797 to apply for a new or revalidated visa during the validity period of the petition. The copy of Form I-797 shall be retained by the beneficiary and presented during the validity of the petition when reentering the United States to resume the same employment with the same petitioner.</p><p>(19) <em>Additional fee for filing certain H-1B petitions.</em> (i) A United States employer (other than an exempt employer as defined in paragraph (h)(19)(iii) of this section) who files a Form I-129, on or after December 1, 1998, and before October 1, 2001, must include the additional fee required in &sect; 103.7(b)(1) of this chapter, if the petition is filed for any of the following purposes:</p><p>(A) An initial grant of H-1B status under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) of the Act;</p><p>(B) An initial extension of stay, as provided in paragraph (h)(15)(i) of this section; or</p><p>(C) Authorization for a change in employers, as provided in paragraph (h)(2)(i)(D) of this section.</p><p>(ii) A petitioner must submit the $110 filing fee and additional $500 filing fee in a single remittance totaling $610. Payment of the $610 sum ($110 filing fee and additional $500 filing fee) must be made at the same time to constitute a single remittance. A petitioner may submit two checks, one in the amount of $500 and the other in the amount of $110. The Service will accept remittances of the $500 fee only from the United States employer or its representative of record, as defined under 8 CFR part 292 and 8 CFR 103.2(a).</p><p>(iii) The following exempt organizations are not required to pay the additional fee:</p><p>(A) <em>An institution of higher education,</em> as defined in section 101(a) of the Higher Education Act of 1965;</p><p>(B) <em>An affiliated or related nonprofit entity.</em> A nonprofit entity (including but not limited to hospitals and medical or research institutions) that is connected or associated with an institution of higher education, through shared ownership or control by the same board or federation operated by an institution of higher education, or attached to an institution of higher education as a member, branch, cooperative, or subsidiary; or</p><p>(C) <em>A nonprofit research organization or governmental research organization.</em> A nonprofit research organization is an organization that is primarily engaged in basic research and/or applied research. A governmental research organization is a United States Government entity whose primary mission is the performance or promotion of basic research and/or applied research. Basic research is general research to gain more comprehensive knowledge or understanding of the subject under study, without specific applications in mind. Basic research is also research that advances scientific knowledge, but does not have specific immediate commercial objectives although it may be in fields of present or potential commercial interest. It may include research and investigation in the sciences, social sciences, or humanities. Applied research is research to gain knowledge or understanding to determine the means by which a specific, recognized need may be met. Applied research includes investigations oriented to discovering new scientific knowledge that has specific commercial objectives with respect to products, processes, or services. It may include research and investigation in the sciences, social sciencies, or humanities.</p><p>(iv) <em>Non-profit or tax exempt organizations.</em> For purposes of paragraphs (h)(19)(iii) (B) and (C) of this section, a nonprofit organization or entity is:</p><p>(A) Defined as a tax exempt organization under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, section 501(c)(3), (c)(4) or (c)(6), 26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3), (c)(4) or (c)(6), and</p><p>(B) Has been approved as a tax exempt organization for research or educational purposes by the Internal Revenue Service.</p><p>(v) <em>Filing situations where the $500 filing fee is not required.</em> The $500 filing fee is not required:</p><p>(A) If the petition is an amended H-1B petition that does not contain any requests for an extension of stay;</p><p>(B) If the petition is an H-1B petition filed for the sole purpose of correcting a Service error; or</p><p>(C) If the petition is the second or subsequent request for an extension of stay filed by the employer regardless of when the first extension of stay was filed or whether the $500 filing fee was paid on the initial petition or the first extension of stay.</p><p>(vi) <em>Petitioners required to file Form I-129W.</em> All petitioners must submit Form I-129W with the appropriate supporting documentation with the petition for an H-1B nonimmigrant alien. Petitioners who do not qualify for a fee exemption are required only to fill our Part A of Form I-129W.</p><p>(vii) <em>Evidence to be submitted in support of the Form I-129W.</em> (A) Employer claiming to be exempt. An employer claiming to be exempt from the $500 filing fee must complete both Parts A and B of Form I-129W along with Form I-129. The employer must also submit evidence as described on Form I-129W establishing that it meets one of the exemptions described at paragraph (h)(19)(iii) of this section. A United States employer claiming an exemption from the $500 filing fee on the basis that it is a non-profit research organization must submit evidence that it has tax exempt status under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, section 501(c)(3), (c)(4) or (c)(6), 26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3), (c)(4) or (c)(6). All other employers claiming an exemption must submit a statement describing why the organization or entity is exempt.</p><p>(B) Exempt filing situations. Any non-exempt employer who claims that the $500 filing fee does not apply with respect to a particular filing for one of the reasons described in &sect; 214.2(h)(19)(v), must submit a statement describing why the filing fee is not required.</p><p>(i) <em>Representatives of information media.</em> The admission of an alien of the class defined in section 101(a)(15)(I) of the Act constitutes an agreement by the alien not to change the information medium or his or her employer until he or she obtains permission to do so from the district director having jurisdiction over his or her residence. An alien classified as an information media nonimmigrant (I) may be authorized admission for the duration of employment.</p><p>(j) <em>Exchange aliens</em>&mdash;(1) <em>General</em>&mdash;(i) <em>Eligibility for admission.</em> A nonimmigrant exchange visitor and his or her accompanying spouse and minor children may be admitted into the United States in J-1 and J-2 classifications under section 101(a)(15)(J) of the Act, if the exchange visitor and his or her accompanying spouse and children each presents a SEVIS Form DS-2019 issued in his or her own name by a program approved by the Department of State for participation by J-1 exchange visitors. Prior to August 1, 2003, if exigent circumstances are demonstrated, the Service will allow the dependent of an exchange visitor possessing a SEVIS Form DS-2019 to enter the United States using a copy of the exchange visitor's SEVIS Form DS-2019. However, where the exchange visitor presents a properly completed Form DS-2019, Certificate of Eligibility for Exchange Visitor (J-1) Status, which was issued to the J-1 exchange visitor by a program approved by the Department of State for participation by exchange visitors and which remains valid for the admission of the exchange visitor, the accompanying spouse and children may be admitted on the basis of the J-1's non-SEVIS Form DS-2019.</p><p>(ii) <em>Admission period.</em> An exchange alien, and J-2 spouse and children, may be admitted for a period up to 30 days before the report date or start of the approved program listed on Form DS-2019. The initial admission of an exchange visitor, spouse and children may not exceed the period specified on Form DS-2019, plus a period of 30 days for the purposes of travel or for the period designated by the Commissioner as provided in paragraph (j)(1)(vi) of this section. Regulations of the Department of State published at 22 CFR part 62 give general limitations on the stay of the various classes of exchange visitors. A spouse or child may not be admitted for longer than the principal exchange visitor.</p><p>(iii) <em>Readmission.</em> An exchange alien may be readmitted to the United States for the remainder of the time authorized on Form I-94, without presenting Form IAP-66, if the alien is returning from a visit solely to foreign contiguous territory or adjacent islands after an absence of less than 30 days and if the original Form I-94 is presented. All other exchange aliens must present a valid Form IAP-66. An original Form IAP-66 or copy three (the pink copy) of a previously issued form presented by an exchange alien returning from a temporary absence shall be retained by the exchange alien for re-entries during the balance of the alien's stay.</p><p>(iv) <em>Extensions of Stay.</em> If an exchange alien requires an extension beyond the initial admission period, the alien shall apply by submitting a new Form DS-2019 which indicates the date to which the alien's program is extended. The extension may not exceed the period specified on Form DS-2019, plus a period of 30 days for the purpose of travel. Extensions of stay for the alien's spouse and children require, as an attachment to Form DS-2019, Form I-94 for each dependent, and a list containing the names of the applicants, dates and places of birth, passport numbers, issuing countries, and expiration dates. An accompanying spouse or child may not be granted an extension of stay for longer than the principal exchange alien.</p><p>(v) <em>Employment.</em> (A) The accompanying spouse and minor children of a J-1 exchange visitor may accept employment only with authorization by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. A request for employment authorization must be made on Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, with fee, as required by the Service, to the district director having jurisdiction over the J-1 exchange visitor's temporary residence in the United States. Income from the spouse's or dependent's employment may be used to support the family's customary recreational and cultural activities and related travel, among other things. Employment will not be authorized if this income is needed to support the J-1 principal alien.</p><p>(B) J-2 employment may be authorized for the duration of the J-1 principal alien's authorized stay as indicated on Form I-94 or a period of four years, whichever is shorter. The employment authorization is valid only if the J-1 is maintaining status. Where a J-2 spouse or dependent child has filed a timely application for extension of stay, only upon approval of the request for extension of stay may he or she apply for a renewal of the employment authorization on a Form I-765 with the required fee.</p><p>(vi) <em>Extension of duration of status.</em> The Commissioner may, by notice in the <em>Federal Register,</em> at any time she determines that the H-1B numerical limitation as described in section 214(g)(1)(A) of the Act will likely be reached prior to the end of a current fiscal year, extend for such a period of time as the Commissioner deems necessary to complete the adjudication of the H-1B application, the duration of status of any J-1 alien on behalf of whom an employer has timely filed an application for change of status to H-1B. The alien, in accordance with 8 CFR part 248, must not have violated the terms of his or her nonimmigrant stay and is not subject to the 2-year foreign residence requirement at 212(e) of the Act. Any J-1 student whose duration of status has been extended shall be considered to be maintaining lawful nonimmigrant status for all purposes under the Act, provided that the alien does not violate the terms and conditions of his or her J nonimmigrant stay. An extension made under this paragraph also applies to the J-2 dependent aliens.</p><p>(vii) <em>Use of SEVIS.</em> At a date to be established by the Department of State, the use of the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) will become mandatory for designated program sponsors. After that date, which will be announced by publication in the <em>Federal Register,</em> all designated program sponsors must begin issuance of the SEVIS Form DS-2019.</p><p>(viii) <em>Current name and address.</em> A J-1 exchange visitor must inform the Service and the responsible officer of the exchange visitor program of any legal changes to his or her name or of any change of address, within 10 days of the change, in a manner prescribed by the program sponsor. A J-1 exchange visitor enrolled in a SEVIS program can satisfy the requirement in 8 CFR 265.1 of notifying the Service by providing a notice of a change of address within 10 days to the responsible officer, who in turn shall enter the information in SEVIS within 21 days of notification by the exchange visitor. A J-1 exchange visitor enrolled at a non-SEVIS program must submit a change of address to the Service, as provided in 8 CFR 265.1, within 10 days of the change. Except in the case of an exchange visitor who cannot receive mail where he or she resides, the address provided by the exchange visitor must be the actual physical location where the exchange visitor resides rather than a mailing address. In cases where an exchange visitor provides a mailing address, the exchange visitor program must maintain a record of, and must provide upon request from the Service, the actual physical location where the exchange visitor resides.</p><p>(2) <em>Special reporting requirement.</em> Each exchange alien participating in a program of graduate medical education or training shall file Form I-644 (Supplementary Statement for Graduate Medical Trainees) annually with the Service attesting to the conditions as specified on the form. The exchange alien shall also submit Form I-644 as an attachment to a completed Form DS-2019 when applying for an extension of stay.</p><p>(3) <em>Alien in cancelled programs.</em> When the approval of an exchange visitor program is withdrawn by the Director of the United States Information Agency, the district director shall send a notice of the withdrawal to each participant in the program and a copy of each such notice shall be sent to the program sponsor. If the exchange visitor is currently engaged in activities authorized by the cancelled program, the participant is authorized to remain in the United States to engage in those activities until expiration of the period of stay previously authorized. The district director shall notify participants in cancelled programs that permission to remain in the United States as an exchange visitor, or extension of stay may be obtained if the participant is accepted in another approved program and a Form DS-2019, executed by the new program sponsor, is submitted. In this case, a release from the sponsor of the cancelled program will not be required.</p><p>(4) <em>Eligibility requirements for section 101(a)(15)(J) classification for aliens desiring to participate in programs under which they will receive graduate medical education or training</em>&mdash;(i) <em>Requirements.</em> Any alien coming to the United States as an exchange visitor to participate in a program under which the alien will receive graduate medical education or training, or any alien seeking to change nonimmigrant status to that of an exchange visitor on Form I-506 for that purpose, must have passed parts of I and II of the National Board of Medical Examiners Examination (or an equivalent examination as determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services), and must be competent in oral and written English, and shall submit a completely executed and valid Form DS-2019.</p><p>(ii) <em>Exemptions.</em> From January 10, 1978 until December 31, 1983, any alien who has come to or seeks to come to the United States as an exchange visitor to participate in an accredited program of graduate medical education or training, or any alien who seeks to change nonimmigrant status for that purpose, may be admitted to participate in such program without regard to the requirements stated in subparagraphs (A) and (B)(ii)(I) of section 212(j)(1) of the Act if a substantial disruption in the health services provided by such program would result from not permitting the alien to participate in the program: <em>Provided</em> that the exemption will not increase the total number of aliens then participating in such programs to a level greater than that participating on January 10, 1978.</p><p>(5) <em>Remittance of the fee.</em> An alien who applies for J-1 nonimmigrant status in order to commence participation in a Department of State-designated exchange visitor program is required to pay the SEVIS fee to DHS, pursuant to 8 CFR 214.13, except as otherwise provided in that section.</p><p>(k) <em>Spouses, Fianc&eacute;es, and Fianc&eacute;s of United States Citizens</em>&mdash;(1) <em>Petition and supporting documents.</em> To be classified as a fiance or fiancee as defined in section 101(a)(15)(K)(i) of the Act, an alien must be the beneficiary of an approved visa petition filed on Form -I-129F. The petition with supporting documents shall be filed by the petitioner with the director having administrative jurisdiction over the place where the petitioner is residing in the United States. A copy of a document submitted in support of a visa petition filed pursuant to section 214(d) of the Act and this paragraph may be accepted, though unaccompanied by the original, if the copy bears a certification by an attorney, typed or rubber-stamped, in the language set forth in &sect; 204.2(j) of this chapter. However, the original document shall be submitted if requested by the Service.</p><p>(2) <em>Requirement that petitioner and K-1 beneficiary have met.</em> The petitioner shall establish to the satisfaction of the director that the petitioner and K-1 beneficiary have met in person within the two years immediately preceding the filing of the petition. As a matter of discretion, the director may exempt the petitioner from this requirement only if it is established that compliance would result in extreme hardship to the petitioner or that compliance would violate strict and long-established customs of the K-1 beneficiary's foreign culture or social practice, as where marriages are traditionally arranged by the parents of the contracting parties and the prospective bride and groom are prohibited from meeting subsequent to the arrangement and prior to the wedding day. In addition to establishing that the required meeting would be a violation of custom or practice, the petitioner must also establish that any and all other aspects of the traditional arrangements have been or will be met in accordance with the custom or practice. Failure to establish that the petitioner and K-1 beneficiary have met within the required period or that compliance with the requirement should be waived shall result in the denial of the petition. Such denial shall be without prejudice to the filing of a new petition once the petitioner and K-1 beneficiary have met in person.</p><p>(3) <em>Children of beneficiary.</em> Without the approval of a separate petition on his or her behalf, a child of the beneficiary (as defined in section 101(b)(1)(A), (B), (C), (D), or (E) of the Act) may be accorded the same nonimmigrant classification as the beneficiary if accompanying or following to join him or her.</p><p>(4) <em>Notification.</em> The petitioner shall be notified of the decision and, if the petition is denied, of the reasons therefor and of the right to appeal in accordance with the provisions of part 103 of this chapter.</p><p>(5) <em>Validity.</em> The approval of a petition under this paragraph shall be valid for a period of four months. A petition which has expired due to the passage of time may be revalidated by a director or a consular officer for a period of four months from the date of revalidation upon a finding that the petitioner and K-1 beneficiary are free to marry and intend to marry each other within 90 days of the beneficiary's entry into the United States. The approval of any petition is automatically terminated when the petitioner dies or files a written withdrawal of the petition before the beneficiary arrives in the United States.</p><p>(6) <em>Adjustment of status from nonimmigrant to immigrant.</em></p><p>(i) [Reserved]</p><p>(ii) <em>Nonimmigrant visa issued on or after November 10, 1986.</em> Upon contracting a valid marriage to the petitioner within 90 days of his or her admission as a nonimmigrant pursuant to a valid K-1 visa issued on or after November 10, 1986, the K-1 beneficiary and his or her minor children may apply for adjustment of status to lawful permanent resident under section 245 of the Act. Upon approval of the application the director shall record their lawful admission for permanent residence in accordance with that section and subject to the conditions prescribed in section 216 of the Act.</p><p>(7) <em>Eligibility, petition and supporting documents for K-3/K-4 classification.</em> To be classified as a K-3 spouse as defined in section 101(a)(15)(k)(ii) of the Act, or the K-4 child of such alien defined in section 101(a)(15)(K)(iii) of the Act, the alien spouse must be the beneficiary of an immigrant visa petition filed by a U.S. citizen on Form I-130, Petition for Alien Relative, and the beneficiary of an approved petition for a K-3 nonimmigrant visa filed on Form I-129F. The petitions with supporting documents shall be filed by the petitioner with the director having administrative jurisdiction over the place where the petitioner is residing in the United States, or such other place as the Commissioner may designate.</p><p>(8) <em>Period of admission for K3/K-4 status.</em> Aliens entering the United States as a K-3 shall be admitted for a period of 2 years. Aliens entering the United States as a K-4 shall be admitted for a period of 2 years or until that alien's 21st birthday, whichever is shorter.</p><p>(9) <em>Employment authorization.</em> An alien admitted to the United States as a nonimmigrant under section 101(a)(15)(K) of the Act shall be authorized to work incident to status for the period of authorized stay. K-1/K-2 aliens seeking work authorization must apply, with fee, to the Service for work authorization pursuant to &sect; 274a.12(a)(6) of this chapter. K-3/K-4 aliens must apply to the Service for a document evidencing employment authorization pursuant to &sect; 274a.12(a)(9) of this chapter. Employment authorization documents issued to K-3/K-4 aliens may be renewed only upon a showing that the applicant has an application or petition awaiting approval, equivalent to the showing required for an extension of stay pursuant to &sect; 214.2(k)(10).</p><p>(10) <em>Extension of stay for K-3/K-4 status</em>&mdash;(i) <em>General.</em> A K-3/K-4 alien may apply for extension of stay, on Form I-539, Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status, 120 days prior to the expiration of his or her authorized stay. Extensions for K-4 status must be filed concurrently with the alien's parent's K-3 status extension application. In addition, the citizen parent of a K-4 alien filing for extension of K status should file Form I-130 on their behalf. Extension will be granted in 2-year intervals upon a showing of eligibility pursuant to section 101(a)(15)(K)(ii) or (iii) of the Act. Aliens wishing to extend their period of stay as a K-3 or K-4 alien pursuant to &sect; 214.1(c)(2) must show that one of the following has been filed with the Service or the Department of State, as applicable, and is awaiting approval:</p><p>(A) The Form I-130, Petition for Alien Relative, filed by the K-3's U.S. citizen spouse who filed the Form I-129F;</p><p>(B) An application for an immigrant visa based on a Form I-130 described in &sect; 214.2(K)(10)(i);</p><p>(C) A Form I-485, Application for Adjustment to that of Permanent Residence, based on a Form I-130 described in &sect; 214.2(k)(10)(i);</p><p>(ii) <em>&ldquo;Good Cause&rdquo; showing.</em> Aliens may file for an extension of stay as a K-3/K-4 nonimmigrant after a Form I-130 filed on their behalf has been approved, without filing either an application for adjustment of status or an immigrant visa upon a showing of &ldquo;good cause.&rdquo; A showing of &ldquo;good cause&rdquo; may include an illness, a job loss, or some other catastrophic event that has prevented the filing of an adjustment of status application by the K-3/K-4 alien. The event or events must have taken place since the alien entered the United States as a K-3/K-4 nonimmigrant. The burden of establishing &ldquo;good cause&rdquo; rests solely with the applicant. Whether the applicant has shown &ldquo;good cause&rdquo; is a purely discretionary decision by the Service from which there is no appeal.</p><p>(11) <em>Termination of K-3/K-4 status.</em> The status of an alien admitted to the United States as a K-3/K-4 under section 101(a)(15)(K)(ii) or (iii) of the Act, shall be automatically terminated 30 days following the occurrence of any of the following:</p><p>(i) The denial or revocation of the Form I-130 filed on behalf of that alien;</p><p>(ii) The denial or revocation of the immigrant visa application filed by that alien;</p><p>(iii) The denial or revocation of the alien's application for adjustment of status to that of lawful permanent residence;</p><p>(iv) The K-3 spouse's divorce from the U.S. citizen becomes final;</p><p>(v) The marriage of an alien in K-4 status.</p><p>(vi) The denial of any of these petitions or applications to a K-3 also results in termination of a dependent K-4's status. For purposes of this section, there is no denial or revocation of a petition or application until the administrative appeal applicable to that application or petition has been exhausted.</p><p>(l) <em>Intracompany transferees</em>&mdash;(1) <em>Admission of intracompany transferees</em>&mdash;(i) <em>General.</em> Under section 101(a)(15)(L) of the Act, an alien who within the preceding three years has been employed abroad for one continuous year by a qualifying organization may be admitted temporarily to the United States to be employed by a parent, branch, affiliate, or subsidiary of that employer in a managerial or executive capacity, or in a position requiring specialized knowledge. An alien transferred to the United States under this nonimmigrant classification is referred to as an intracompany transferee and the organization which seeks the classification of an alien as an intracompany transferee is referred to as the petitioner. The Service has responsibility for determining whether the alien is eligible for admission and whether the petitioner is a qualifying organization. These regulations set forth the standards applicable to these classifications. They also set forth procedures for admission of intracompany transferees and appeal of adverse decisions. Certain petitioners seeking the classification of aliens as intracompany transferees may file blanket petitions with the Service. Under the blanket petition process, the Service is responsible for determining whether the petitioner and its parent, branches, affiliates, or subsidiaries specified are qualifying organizations. The Department of State or, in certain cases, the Service is responsible for determining the classification of the alien.</p><p>(ii) <em>Definitions</em>&mdash;(A) <em>Intracompany transferee</em> means an alien who, within three years preceding the time of his or her application for admission into the United States, has been employed abroad continuously for one year by a firm or corporation or other legal entity or parent, branch, affiliate, or subsidiary thereof, and who seeks to enter the United States temporarily in order to render his or her services to a branch of the same employer or a parent, affiliate, or subsidiary thereof in a capacity that is managerial, executive, or involves specialized knowledge. Periods spent in the United States in lawful status for a branch of the same employer or a parent, affiliate, or subsidiary thereof and brief trips to the United States for business or pleasure shall not be interruptive of the one year of continuous employment abroad but such periods shall not be counted toward fulfillment of that requirement.</p><p>(B) <em>Managerial capacity</em> means an assignment within an organization in which the employee primarily:</p><p>(<em>1</em>) Manages the organization, or a department, subdivision, function, or component of the organization;</p><p>(<em>2</em>) Supervises and controls the work of other supervisory, professional, or managerial employees, or manages an essential function within the organization, or a department or subdivision of the organization;</p><p>(<em>3</em>) Has the authority to hire and fire or recommend those as well as other personnel actions (such as promotion and leave authorization) if another employee or other employees are directly supervised; if no other employee is directly supervised, functions at a senior level within the organizational hierarchy or with respect to the function managed; and</p><p>(<em>4</em>) Exercises discretion over the day-to-day operations of the activity or function for which the employee has authority.

The petitioner shall advise the Service whether it has filed a petition for the same beneficiary with another office, and certify that it will not file a petition for the same beneficiary with another office, unless the circumstances and conditions in the initial petition have changed. Failure to make a full disclosure of previous petitions filed may result in a denial of the petition.</p><p>(ii) A United States petitioner which meets the requirements of paragraph (l)(4) of this section and seeks continuing approval of itself and its parent, branches, specified subsidiaries and affiliates as qualifying organizations and, later, classification under section 101(a)(15)(L) of multiple numbers of aliens employed by itself, its parent, or those branches, subsidiaries, or affiliates may file a blanket petition on Form I-129 with the director having jurisdiction over the area where the petitioner is located. The blanket petition shall be adjudicated and maintained at the appropriate Service Center. Approved blanket petition files shall be maintained indefinitely by that Service Center.

however, the work in the United States need not be the same work which the alien performed abroad.</p><p>(v) If the petition indicates that the beneficiary is coming to the United States as a manager or executive to open or to be employed in a new office in the United States, the petitioner shall submit evidence that:</p><p>(A) Sufficient physical premises to house the new office have been secured;</p><p>(B) The beneficiary has been employed for one continuous year in the three year period preceding the filing of the petition in an executive or managerial capacity and that the proposed employment involved executive or managerial authority over the new operation;

An individual petition may be filed by the petitioner or organizations in lieu of using the blanket petition procedure. However, the petitioner and other qualifying organizations may not seek L classification for the same alien under both procedures, unless a consular officer first denies eligibility. Whenever a petitioner which has blanket L approval files an individual petition to seek L classification for a manager, executive, or specialized knowledge professional, the petitioner shall advise the Service that it has blanket L approval and certify that the beneficiary has not and will not apply to a consular officer for L classification under the approved blanket petition.</p><p>(iv) <em>Evidence.</em> A blanket petition filed on Form I-129 shall be accompanied by:</p><p>(A) Evidence that the petitioner meets the requirements of paragraph (l)(4)(i) of this section.</p><p>(B) Evidence that all entities for which approval is sought are qualifying organizations as defined in subparagraph (l)(1)(ii)(G) of this section.            </p><p>(C) Such other evidence as the director, in his or her discretion, deems necessary in a particular case.</p><p>(5) <em>Certification and admission procedures for beneficiaries under blanket petition</em>&mdash;(i) <em>Jurisdiction.</em> United States consular officers shall have authority to determine eligibility of individual beneficiaries outside the United States seeking L classification under blanket petitions, except for visa-exempt nonimmigrants. An application for a visa-exempt nonimmigrant seeking L classification under a blanket petition or by an alien in the United States applying for change of status to L classification under a blanket petition shall be filed with the Service office at which the blanket petition was filed.</p><p>(ii) <em>Procedures.</em> (A) When one qualifying organization listed in an approved blanket petition wishes to transfer an alien outside the United States to a qualifying organization in the United States and the alien requires a visa to enter the United States, that organization shall complete Form I-129S, Certificate of Eligibility for Intracompany Transferee under a Blanket Petition, in an original and three copies. The qualifying organization shall retain one copy for its records and send the original and two copies to the alien. A copy of the approved Form I-797 must be attached to the original and each copy of Form I-129S.</p><p>(B) After receipt of Form I-797 and Form I-129S, a qualified employee who is being transferred to the United States may use these documents to apply for visa issuance with the consular officer within six months of the date on Form I-129S.</p><p>(C) When the alien is a visa-exempt nonimmigrant seeking L classification under a blanket petition, or when the alien is in the United States and is seeking a change of status from another nonimmigrant classification to L classification under a blanket petition, the petitioner shall submit Form I-129S, Certificate of Eligibility, and a copy of the approval notice, Form I-797, to the Service Center with which the blanket petition was filed.</p><p>(D) The consular or Service officer shall determine whether the position in which the alien will be employed in the United States is with an organization named in the approved petition and whether the specific job is for a manager, executive, or specialized knowledge professional. The consular or Service officer shall determine further whether the alien's immediate prior year of continuous employment abroad was with an organization named in the petition and was in a position as manager, executive, or specialized knowledge professional.</p><p>(E) Consular officers may grant &ldquo;L&rdquo; classification only in clearly approvable applications. If the consular officer determines that the alien is eligible for L classification, the consular officer may issue a nonimmigrant visa, noting the visa classification &ldquo;Blanket L-1&rdquo; for the principal alien and &ldquo;Blanket L-2&rdquo; for any accompanying or following to join spouse and children. The consular officer shall also endorse all copies of the alien's Form I-129S with the blanket L-1 visa classification and return the original and one copy to the alien. When the alien is inspected for entry into the United States, both copies of the Form I-129S shall be stamped to show a validity period not to exceed three years and the second copy collected and sent to the appropriate Regional Service Center for control purposes. Service officers who determine eligibility of aliens for L-1 classification under blanket petitions shall endorse both copies of Form I-129S with the blanket L-1 classification and the validity period not to exceed three years and retain the second copy for Service records.</p><p>(F) If the consular officer determines that the alien is ineligible for L classification under a blanket petition, the consular officer's decision shall be final. The consular officer shall record the reasons for the denial on Form I-129S, retain one copy, return the original of I-129S to the Service office which approved the blanket petition, and provide a copy to the alien. In such a case, an individual petition may be filed for the alien with the director having jurisdiction over the area of intended employment; the petition shall state the reason the alien was denied L classification and specify the consular office which made the determination and the date of the determination.            </p><p>(G) An alien admitted under an approved blanket petition may be reassigned to any organization listed in the approved petition without referral to the Service during his/her authorized stay if the alien will be performing virtually the same job duties. If the alien will be performing different job duties, the petitioner shall complete a new Certificate of Eligibility and send it for approval to the director who approved the blanket petition.</p><p>(6) <em>Copies of supporting documents.</em> The petitioner may submit a legible photocopy of a document in support of the visa petition, in lieu of the original document. However, the original document shall be submitted if requested by the Service.</p><p>(7) <em>Approval of petition</em>&mdash;(i) <em>General.</em> The director shall notify the petitioner of the approval of an individual or a blanket petition within 30 days after the date a completed petition has been filed. If additional information is required from the petitioner, the 30 day processing period shall begin again upon receipt of the information. Only the Director of a Service Center may approve individual and blanket L petitions. The original Form I-797 received from the Service with respect to an approved individual or blanket petition may be duplicated by the petitioner for the beneficiary's use as described in paragraph (l)(13) of this section.</p><p>(A) <em>Individual petition</em>&mdash;(<em>1</em>) Form I-797 shall include the beneficiary's name and classification and the petition's period of validity.</p><p>(<em>2</em>) An individual petition approved under this paragraph shall be valid for the period of established need for the beneficiary's services, not to exceed three years, except where the beneficiary is coming to the United States to open or to be employed in a new office.</p><p>(<em>3</em>) If the beneficiary is coming to the United States to open or be employed in a new office, the petition may be approved for a period not to exceed one year, after which the petitioner shall demonstrate as required by paragraph (l)(14)(ii) of this section that it is doing business as defined in paragraph (l) (1)(ii)(H) of this section to extend the validity of the petition.</p><p>(B) <em>Blanket petition.</em> (<em>1</em>) Form I-797 shall identify the approved organizations included in the petition and the petition's period of validity.</p><p>(<em>2</em>) A blanket petition approved under this paragraph shall be valid initially for a period of three years and may be extended indefinitely thereafter if the qualifying organizations have complied with these regulations.</p><p>(<em>3</em>) A blanket petition may be approved in whole or in part and shall cover only qualifying organizations.</p><p>(C) <em>Amendments.</em> The petitioner shall file an amended petition, with fee, at the Service Center where the original petition was filed to reflect changes in approved relationships, additional qualifying organizations under a blanket petition, change in capacity of employment (<em>i.e.</em>, from a specialized knowledge position to a managerial position), or any information which would affect the beneficiary's eligibility under section 101(a)(15)(L) of the Act.</p><p>(ii) <em>Spouse and dependents.</em> The spouse and unmarried minor children of the beneficiary are entitled to L nonimmigrant classification, subject to the same period of admission and limits as the beneficiary, if the spouse and unmarried minor children are accompanying or following to join the beneficiary in the United States. Neither the spouse nor any child may accept employment unless he or she has been granted employment authorization.</p><p>(8) <em>Denial of petition</em>&mdash;(i) <em>Individual petition.</em> If an individual is denied, the petitioner shall be notified within 30 days after the date a completed petition has been filed of the denial, the reasons for the denial, and the right to appeal the denial.</p><p>(ii) <em>Blanket petition.</em> If a blanket petition is denied in whole or in part, the petitioner shall be notified within 30 days after the date a completed petition has been filed of the denial, the reasons for the denial, and the right to appeal the denial. If the petition is denied in part, the Service Center issuing the denial shall forward to the petitioner, along with the denial, a Form I-797 listing those organizations which were found to quality. If the decision to deny is reversed on appeal, a new Form I-797 shall be sent to the petitioner to reflect the changes made as a result of the appeal.</p><p>(9) <em>Revocation of approval of individual and blanket petitions</em>&mdash;(i) <em>General.</em> The director may revoke a petition at any time, even after the expiration of the petition.</p><p>(ii) <em>Automatic revocation.</em> The approval of any individual or blanket petition is automatically revoked if the petitioner withdraws the petition or the petitioner fails to request indefinite validity of a blanket petition.</p><p>(iii) <em>Revocation on notice.</em> (A) The director shall send to the petitioner a notice of intent to revoke the petition in relevant part if he/she finds that:</p><p>(<em>1</em>) One or more entities are no longer qualifying organizations;</p><p>(<em>2</em>) The alien is no longer eligible under section 101(a)(15)(L) of the Act;</p><p>(<em>3</em>) A qualifying organization(s) violated requirements of section 101(a)(15)(L) and these regulations;</p><p>(<em>4</em>) The statement of facts contained in the petition was not true and correct; or</p><p>(<em>5</em>) Approval of the petition involved gross error; or</p><p>(<em>6</em>) None of the qualifying organizations in a blanket petition have used the blanket petition procedure for three consecutive years.</p><p>(B) The notice of intent to revoke shall contain a detailed statement of the grounds for the revocation and the time period allowed for the petitioner's rebuttal. Upon receipt of this notice, the petitioner may submit evidence in rebuttal within 30 days of the notice. The director shall consider all relevant evidence presented in deciding whether to revoke the petition in whole or in part. If a blanket petition is revoked in part, the remainder of the petition shall remain approved, and a revised Form I-797 shall be sent to the petitioner with the revocation notice.</p><p>(iv) <em>Status of beneficiaries.</em> If an individual petition is revoked, the beneficiary shall be required to leave the United States, unless the beneficiary has obtained other work authorization from the Service. If a blanket petition is revoked and the petitioner and beneficiaries already in the United States are otherwise eligible for L classification, the director shall extend the blanket petition for a period necessary to support the stay of those blanket L beneficiaries. The approval notice, Form I-171C, shall include only the names of qualifying organizations and covered beneficiaries. No new beneficiaries may be classified or admitted under this limited extension.</p><p>(10) <em>Appeal of denial or revocation of individual or blanket petition.</em> (i) A petition denied in whole or in part may be appealed under 8 CFR part 103. Since the determination on the Certificate of Eligibility, Form I-129S, is part of the petition process, a denial or revocation of approval of an I-129S is appealable in the same manner as the petition.</p><p>(ii) A petition that has been revoked on notice in whole or in part may be appealed under part 103 of this chapter. Automatic revocations may not be appealed.</p><p>(11) <em>Admission.</em> A beneficiary may apply for admission to the United States only while the individual or blanket petition is valid. The beneficiary of an individual petition shall not be admitted for a date past the validity period of the petition. The beneficiary of a blanket petition may be admitted for three years even though the initial validity period of the blanket petition may expire before the end of the three-year period. If the blanket petition will expire while the alien is in the United States, the burden is on the petitioner to file for indefinite validity of the blanket petition or to file an individual petition in the alien's behalf to support the alien's status in the United States. The admission period for any alien under section 101(a)(15)(L) shall not exceed three years unless an extension of stay is granted pursuant to paragraph (l)(15) of this section.</p><p>(12) <em>L-1 limitation on period of stay</em>&mdash;(i) <em>Limits.</em> An alien who has spent five years in the United States in a specialized knowledge capacity or seven years in the United States in a managerial or executive capacity under section 101(a)(15) (L) and/or (H) of the Act may not be readmitted to the United States under section 101(a)(15) (L) or (H) of the Act unless the alien has resided and been physically present outside the United States, except for brief visits for business or pleasure, for the immediate prior year. Such visits do not interrupt the one year abroad, but do not count towards fulfillment of that requirement. In view of this restriction, a new individual petition may not be approved for an alien who has spent the maximum time period in the United States under section 101(a)(15) (L) and/or (H) of the Act, unless the alien has resided and been physically present outside the United States, except for brief visits for business or pleasure, for the immediate prior year. The petitioner shall provide information about the alien's employment, place of residence, and the dates and purpose of any trips to the United States for the previous year. A consular or Service officer may not grant L classification under a blanket petition to an alien who has spent five years in the United States as a professional with specialized knowledge or seven years in the United States as a manager or executive, unless the alien has met the requirements contained in this paragraph.</p><p>(ii) <em>Exceptions.</em> The limitations of paragraph (l)(12)(i) of this section shall not apply to aliens who do not reside continually in the United States and whose employment in the United States is seasonal, intermittent, or consists of an aggregate of six months or less per year. In addition, the limitations will not apply to aliens who reside abroad and regularly commute to the United States to engage in part-time employment. The petitioner and the alien must provide clear and convincing proof that the alien qualifies for an exception. Clear and convincing proof shall consist of evidence such as arrival and departure records, copies of tax returns, and records of employment abroad.</p><p>(13) <em>Beneficiary's use of Form I-797 and Form I-129S</em>&mdash;(i) <em>Beneficiary of an individual petition.</em> The beneficiary of an individual petition who does not require a nonimmigrant visa may present a copy of Form I-797 at a port of entry to facilitate entry into the United States. The copy of Form I-797 shall be retained by the beneficiary and presented during the validity of the petition (provided that the beneficiary is entering or reentering the United States) for entry and reentry to resume the same employment with the same petitioner (within the validity period of the petition) and to apply for an extension of stay. A beneficiary who is required to present a visa for admission and whose visa will have expired before the date of his or her intended return may use an original Form I-797 to apply for a new or revalidated visa during the validity period of the petition and to apply for an extension of stay.</p><p>(ii) <em>Beneficiary of a blanket petition.</em> Each alien seeking L classification and admission under a blanket petition shall present a copy of Form I-797 and a Form I-129S from the petitioner which identifies the position and organization from which the employee is transferring, the new organization and position to which the employee is destined, a description of the employee's actual duties for both the new and former positions, and the positions, dates, and locations of previous L stays in the United States. A current copy of Form I-797 and Form I-129S should be retained by the beneficiary and used for leaving and reentering the United States to resume employment with a qualifying organization during his/her authorized period of stay, for applying for a new or revalidated visa, and for applying for readmission at a port of entry. The alien may be readmitted even though reassigned to a different organization named on the Form I-797 than the one shown on Form I-129S if the job duties are virtually the same.</p><p>(14) <em>Extension of visa petition validity</em>&mdash;(i) <em>Individual petition.</em> The petitioner shall file a petition extension on Form I-129 to extend an individual petition under section 101(a)(15)(L) of the Act. Except in those petitions involving new offices, supporting documentation is not required, unless requested by the director. A petition extension may be filed only if the validity of the original petition has not expired.</p><p>(ii) <em>New offices.</em> A visa petition under section 101(a)(15)(L) which involved the opening of a new office may be extended by filing a new Form I-129, accompanied by the following:</p><p>(A) Evidence that the United States and foreign entities are still qualifying organizations as defined in paragraph (l)(1)(ii)(G) of this section;            </p><p>(B) Evidence that the United States entity has been doing business as defined in paragraph (l)(1)(ii)(H) of this section for the previous year;</p><p>(C) A statement of the duties performed by the beneficiary for the previous year and the duties the beneficiary will perform under the extended petition;</p><p>(D) A statement describing the staffing of the new operation, including the number of employees and types of positions held accompanied by evidence of wages paid to employees when the beneficiary will be employed in a managerial or executive capacity; and</p><p>(E) Evidence of the financial status of the United States operation.</p><p>(iii) <em>Blanket petitions</em>&mdash;(A) <em>Extension procedure.</em> A blanket petition may only be extended indefinitely by filing a new Form I-129 with a copy of the previous approval notice and a report of admissions during the preceding three years. The report of admissions shall include a list of the aliens admitted under the blanket petition during the preceding three years, including positions held during that period, the employing entity, and the dates of initial admission and final departure of each alien. The petitioner shall state whether it still meets the criteria for filing a blanket petition and shall document any changes in approved relationships and additional qualifying organizations.</p><p>(B) <em>Other conditions.</em> If the petitioner in an approved blanket petition fails to request indefinite validity or if indefinite validity is denied, the petitioner and its other qualifying organizations shall seek L classification by filing individual petitions until another three years have expired; after which the petitioner may seek approval of a new blanket petition.</p><p>(15) <em>Extension of stay.</em> (i) In individual petitions, the petitioner must apply for the petition extension and the alien's extension of stay concurrently on Form -I-129. When the alien is a beneficiary under a blanket petition, a new certificate of eligibility, accompanied by a copy of the previous approved certificate of eligibility, shall be filed by the petitioner to request an extension of the alien's stay. The petitioner must also request a petition extension. The dates of extension shall be the same for the petition and the beneficiary's extension of stay. The beneficiary must be physically present in the United States at the time the extension of stay is filed. Even though the requests to extend the visa petition and the alien's stay are combined on the petition, the director shall make a separate determination on each. If the alien is required to leave the United States for business or personal reasons while the extension requests are pending, the petitioner may request the director to cable notification of approval of the petition extension to the consular office abroad where the alien will apply for a visa.</p><p>(ii) An extension of stay may be authorized in increments of up to two years for beneficiaries of individual and blanket petitions. The total period of stay may not exceed five years for aliens employed in a specialized knowledge capacity. The total period of stay for an alien employed in a managerial or executive capacity may not exceed seven years. No further extensions may be granted. When an alien was initially admitted to the United States in a specialized knowledge capacity and is later promoted to a managerial or executive position, he or she must have been employed in the managerial or executive position for at least six months to be eligible for the total period of stay of seven years. The change to managerial or executive capacity must have been approved by the Service in an amended, new, or extended petition at the time that the change occurred.</p><p>(16) <em>Effect of filing an application for or approval of a permanent labor certification, preference petition, or filing of an application for adjustment of status on L-1 classification.</em> An alien may legitimately come to the United States for a temporary period as an L-1 nonimmigrant and, at the same time, lawfully seek to become a permanent resident of the United States provided he or she intends to depart voluntarily at the end of his or her authorized stay. The filing of an application for or approval of a permanent labor certification, an immigrant visa preference petition, or the filing of an application of readjustment of status for an L-1 nonimmigrant shall not be the basis for denying:            </p><p>(i) An L-1 petition filed on behalf of the alien,</p><p>(ii) A request to extend an L-1 petition which had previously been filed on behalf of the alien;</p><p>(iii) An application for admission as an L-1 nonimmigrant by the alien, or as an L-2 nonimmigrant by the spouse or child of such alien;</p><p>(iv) An application for change of status to H-1 or L-2 nonimmigrant filed by the alien, or to H-1, H-4, or L-1 status filed by the L-2 spouse or child of such alien;</p><p>(v) An application for change of status to H-4 nonimmigrant filed by the L-1 nonimmigrant, if his or her spouse has been approved for classification as an H-1; or</p><p>(vi) An application for extension of stay filed by the alien, or by the L-2 spouse or child of such alien.</p><p>(17) <em>Filing of individual petitions and certifications under blanket petitions for citizens of Canada under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)</em>&mdash;(i) <em>Individual petitions.</em> Except as provided in paragraph (1)(2)(ii) of this section (filing of blanket petitions), a United States or foreign employer seeking to classify a citizen of Canada as an intracompany transferee may file an individual petition in duplicate on Form I-129 in conjunction with an application for admission of the citizen of Canada. Such filing may be made with an immigration officer at a Class A port of entry located on the United States-Canada land border or at a United States pre-clearance/pre-flight station in Canada. The petitioning employer need not appear, but Form I-129 must bear the authorized signature of the petitioner.</p><p>(ii) <em>Certification of eligibility for intracompany transferree under the blanket petition.</em> An immigration officer at a location identified in paragraph (1)(17)(i) of this section may determine eligibility of individual citizens of Canada seeking L classification under approved blanket petitions. At these locations, such citizens of Canada shall present the original and two copies of Form I-129S, Intracompany Transferee Certificate of Eligibility, prepared by the approved organization, as well as three copies of Form I-797, Notice of Approval of Nonimmigrant Visa Petition.</p><p>(iii) Nothing in this section shall preclude or discourage the advance filing of petitions and certificates of eligibility in accordance with paragraph (l)(2) of this section.</p><p>(iv) <em>Deficient or deniable petitions or certificates of eligibility.</em> If a petition or certificate of eligibility submitted concurrently with an application for admission is lacking necessary supporting documentation or is otherwise deficient, the inspecting immigration officer shall return it to the applicant for admission in order to obtain the necessary documentation from the petitioner or for the deficiency to be overcome. The fee to file the petition will be remitted at such time as the documentary or other deficiency is overcome. If the petition or certificate of eligibility is clearly deniable, the immigration officer will accept the petition (with fee) and the petitioner shall be notified of the denial, the reasons for denial, and the right of appeal. If a formal denial order cannot be issued by the port of entry, the petition with a recommendation for denial shall be forwarded to the appropriate Service Center for final action. For the purposes of this provision, the appropriate Service Center will be the one within the same Service region as the location where the application for admission is made.</p><p>(v) <em>Spouse and dependent minor children accompanying or following to join.</em> (A) The Canadian citizen spouse and Canadian citizen unmarried minor children of a Canadian citizen admitted under this paragraph shall be entitled to the same nonimmigrant classification and same length of stay subject to the same limits as the principal alien. They shall not be required to present visas, and they shall be admitted under the classification symbol L-2.</p><p>(B) A non-Canadian citizen spouse or non-Canadian citizen unmarried minor child shall be entitled to the same nonimmigrant classification and the same length of stay subject to the same limits as the principal, but shall be required to present a visa upon application for admission as an L-2 unless otherwise exempt under &sect; 212.1 of this chapter.            </p><p>(C) The spouse and dependent minor children shall not accept employment in the United States unless otherwise authorized under the Act.</p><p>(18) <em>Denial of intracompany transferee status to citizens of Canada or Mexico in the case of certain labor disputes.</em> (i) If the Secretary of Labor certifies to or otherwise informs the Commissioner that a strike or other labor dispute involving a work stoppage of workers is in progress where the beneficiary is to be employed, and the temporary entry of the beneficiary may affect adversely the settlement of such labor dispute or the employment of any person who is involved in such dispute, a petition to classify a citizen of Mexico or Canada as an L-1 intracompany transferee may be denied. If a petition has already been approved, but the alien has not yet entered the United States, or has entered the United States but not yet commenced employment, the approval of the petition may be suspended, and an application for admission on the basis of the petition may be denied.</p><p>(ii) If there is a strike or other labor dispute involving a work stoppage of workers in progress, but such strike or other labor dispute is not certified under paragraph (l)(18)(i) of this section, or the Service has not otherwise been informed by the Secretary that such a strike or labor dispute is in progress, the Commissioner shall not deny a petition or suspend an approved petition.</p><p>(iii) If the alien has already commended employment in the United States under an approved petition and is participating in a strike or other labor dispute involving a work stoppage of workers, whether or not such strike or other labor dispute has been certified by the Department of Labor, the alien shall not be deemed to be failing to maintain his or her status solely on account of past, present, or future participation in a strike or other labor dispute involving a work stoppage of workers, but is subject to the following terms and conditions.</p><p>(A) The alien shall remain subject to all applicable provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act, and regulations promulgated in the same manner as all other L nonimmigrants;</p><p>(B) The status and authorized period of stay of such an alien is not modified or extended in any way by virtue of his or her participation in a strike or other labor dispute involving work stoppage of workers; and</p><p>(C) Although participation by an L nonimmigrant alien in a strike or other labor dispute involving a work stoppage of workers will not constitute a ground for deportation, any alien who violates his or her status or who remains in the United States after his or her authorized period of stay has expired will be subject to deportation.</p><p>(m) <em>Students in established vocational or other recognized nonacademic institutions, other than in language training programs</em>&mdash;(1) <em>Admission of student</em>&mdash;(i) <em>Eligibility for admission.</em> A nonimmigrant student may be admitted into the United States in nonimmigrant status under section 101(a)(15)(M) of the Act, if:</p><p>(A) The student presents a SEVIS Form I-20 issued in his or her own name by a school approved by the Service for attendance by M-1 foreign students. (In the alternative, for a student seeking admission prior to August 1, 2003, the student may present a currently-valid Form I-20M-N/I-20ID, if that form was issued by the school prior to January 30, 2003);</p><p>(B) The student has documentary evidence of financial support in the amount indicated on the SEVIS Form I-20 (or the Form I-20M-N/I-20ID); and</p><p>(C) For students seeking initial admission only, the student intends to attend the school specified in the student's visa (or, where the student is exempt from the requirement for a visa, the school indicated on the SEVIS Form I-20 (or the Form I-20M-N/I-20ID)).</p><p>(ii) <em>Disposition of Form I-20M-N.</em> When a student is admitted to the United States, the inspecting officer shall forward Form I-20M-N to the Service's processing center. The processing center shall forward Form I-20N to the school which issued the form to notify the school of the student's admission.</p><p>(iii) <em>Use of SEVIS.</em> On January 30, 2003, the use of the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) will become mandatory for the issuance of any new Form I-20. A student or dependent who presents a non-SEVIS Form I-20 issued on or after January 30, 2003, will not be accepted for admission to the United States. Non-SEVIS Forms I-20 issued prior to January 30, 2003, will continue to be accepted for admission to the United States until August 1, 2003. However, schools must issue a SEVIS Form I-20 to any current student requiring a reportable action (e.g., extension of status, practical training, and requests for employment authorization) or a new Form I-20, or for any aliens who must obtain a new nonimmigrant student visa. As of August 1, 2003, the records of all current or continuing students must be entered in SEVIS.</p><p>(2) <em>Form I-20 ID copy.</em> The first time an M-1 student comes into contact with the Service for any reason, the student must present to the Service a Form I-20M-N properly and completely filled out by the student and by the designated official of the school the student is attending or intends to attend. The student will be issued a Form I-20 ID copy with his or her admission number. The student must have the Form I-20 ID copy with him or her at all times. If the student loses the Form I-20 ID copy, the student must request a new Form I-20 ID copy on Form I-102 from the Service office having jurisdiction over the school the student was last authorized to attend.</p><p>(3) <em>Admission of the spouse and minor children of an M-1 student.</em> The spouse and minor children accompanying an M-1 student are eligible for admission in M-2 status if the student is admitted in M-1 status. The spouse and minor children following-to-join an M-1 student are eligible for admission to the United States in M-2 status if they are able to demonstrate that the M-1 student has been admitted and is, or will be within 30 days, enrolled in a full course of study, or engaged in approved practical training following completion of studies. In either case, at the time they seek admission, the eligible spouse and minor children of an M-1 student with a SEVIS Form I-20 must individually present an original SEVIS Form I-20 issued in the name of each M-2 dependent issued by a school authorized by the Service for attendance by M-1 foreign students. Prior to August 1, 2003, if exigent circumstances are demonstrated, the Service will allow the dependent of an M-1 student in possession of a SEVIS Form I-20 to enter the United States using a copy of the M-1 student's SEVIS Form I-20. (In the alternative, for dependents seeking admission to the United States prior to August 1, 2003, a copy of the M-1 student's current Form I-20ID issued prior to January 30, 2003, with proper endorsement by the DSO will satisfy this requirement.) A new SEVIS Form I-20 (or Form I-20M-N) is required for a dependent where there has been any substantive change in the M-1 student's current information.</p><p>(i) A properly endorsed page 4 of Form I-20M-N if there has been no substantive change in the information on the student's most recent Form I-20M since the form was initially issued; or</p><p>(ii) A new Form I-20M-N if there has been any substantive change in the information on the student's most recent Form I-20M since the form was initially issued.</p><p>(4) <em>Temporary absence</em>&mdash;(i) <em>General.</em> An M-1 student returning to the United States from a temporary absence to attend the school which the student was previously authorized to attend must present either&mdash;</p><p>(A) A properly endorsed page 4 of Form I-20M-N if there has been no substantive change in the information on the student's most recent Form I-20M since the form was initially issued; or</p><p>(B) A new Form I-20M-N if there has been any substantive change in the information on the student's most recent Form I-20M since the form was initially issued.</p><p>(ii) <em>Student who transferred between schools.</em> If an M-1 student has been authorized to transfer between schools and is returning to the United States from a temporary absence in order to attend the school to which transfer was authorized as indicated on the student's Form I-20 ID copy, the name of the school to which the student is destined does not need to be specified in the student's visa.</p><p>(5) <em>Period of stay.</em> A student in M nonimmigrant status is admitted for a fixed time period, which is the period necessary to complete the course of study indicated on the Form I-20, plus practical training following completion of the course of study, plus an additional 30 days to depart the United States, but not to exceed a total period of one year. An M-1 student may be admitted for a period up to 30 days before the report date or start date of the course of study listed on the Form I-20. An M-1 student who fails to maintain a full course of study or otherwise fails to maintain status is not eligible for the additional 30-day period of stay.</p><p>(6)-(8) [Reserved]</p><p>(9) <em>Full course of study.</em> Successful completion of the course of study must lead to the attainment of a specific educational or vocational objective. A &ldquo;full course of study&rdquo; as required by section 101(a)(15)(M)(i) of the Act means&mdash;</p><p>(i) Study at a community college or junior college, certified by a school official to consist of at least twelve semester or quarter hours of instruction per academic term in those institutions using standard semester, trimester, or quarter-hour systems, where all students enrolled for a minimum of twelve semester or quarter hours are charged full-time tuition or considered full-time for other administrative purposes, or its equivalent (as determined by the district director) except when the student needs a lesser course load to complete the course of study during the current term;</p><p>(ii) Study at a postsecondary vocational or business school, other than in a language training program except as provided in &sect; 214.3(a)(2)(iv), which confers upon its graduates recognized associate or other degrees or has established that its credits have been and are accepted unconditionally by at least three institutions of higher learning which are either: (1) A school (or school system) owned and operated as a public educational institution by the United States or a State or political subdivision thereof; or (2) a school accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting body; and which has been certified by a designated school official to consist of at least twelve hours of instruction a week, or its equivalent as determined by the district director;</p><p>(iii) Study in a vocational or other nonacademic curriculum, other than in a language training program except as provided in &sect; 214.3(a)(2)(iv), certified by a designated school official to consist of at least eighteen clock hours of attendance a week if the dominant part of the course of study consists of classroom instruction, or at least twenty-two clock hours a week if the dominant part of the course of study consists of shop or laboratory work; or</p><p>(iv) Study in a vocational or other nonacademic high school curriculum, certified by a designated school official to consist of class attendance for not less than the minimum number of hours a week prescribed by the school for normal progress towards graduation.</p><p>(v) <em>On-line courses/distance education programs.</em> No on-line or distance education classes may be considered to count toward an M-1 student's full course of study requirement if such classes do not require the student's physical attendance for classes, examination or other purposes integral to completion of the class. An on-line or distance education course is a course that is offered principally through the use of television, audio, or computer transmission including open broadcast, closed circuit, cable, microwave, or satellite, audio conferencing, or computer conferencing.</p><p>(vi) <em>Reduced course load.</em> The designated school official may authorize an M-1 student to engage in less than a full course of study only where the student has been compelled by illness or a medical condition that has been documented by a licensed medical doctor, doctor of osteopathy, or licensed clinical psychologist, to interrupt or reduce his or her course of study. A DSO may not authorize a reduced course load for more than an aggregate of 5 months per course of study. An M-1 student previously authorized to drop below a full course of study due to illness or medical condition for an aggregate of 5 months, may not be authorized by the DSO to reduce his or her course load on subsequent occasions during his or her particular course of study.</p><p>(A) <em>Non-SEVIS schools.</em> A DSO must report any student who has been authorized by the DSO to carry a reduced course load. Within 21 days of the authorization, the DSO must send a photocopy of the student's Form I-20 to the Service's data processing center indicating the date that authorization was granted. The DSO must also report to the Service's data processing center when the student has resumed a full course of study, no more than 21 days from the date the student resumed a full course of study. In this case, the DSO must submit a photocopy of the student's Form I-20 indicating the date that a full course of study was resumed, with a new program end date.</p><p>(B) <em>SEVIS reporting.</em> In order for a student to be authorized to drop below a full course of study, the DSO must update SEVIS prior to the student reducing his or her course load. The DSO must update SEVIS with the date, reason for authorization, and the start date of the next term or session. The DSO must also notify SEVIS within 21 days of the student's commencement of a full course of study.</p><p>(10) <em>Extension of stay</em>&mdash;(i) <em>Eligibility.</em> The cumulative time of extensions that can be granted to an M-1 student is limited to a period of 3 years from the M-1 student's original start date, plus 30 days. No extension can be granted to an M-1 student if the M-1 student is unable to complete the course of study within 3 years of the original program start date. This limit includes extensions that have been granted due to a drop below full course of study, a transfer of schools, or reinstatement. An M-1 student may be granted an extension of stay if it is established that:</p><p>(A) He or she is a bona fide nonimmigrant currently maintaining student status;</p><p>(B) Compelling educational or medical reasons have resulted in a delay to his or her course of study. Delays caused by academic probation or suspension are not acceptable reasons for program extension; and</p><p>(C) He or she is able to, and in good faith intends to, continue to maintain that status for the period for which the extension is granted.</p><p>(ii) <em>Application.</em> A student must apply to the Service for an extension on Form I-539, Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status. A student's M-2 spouse and children seeking an extension of stay must be included in the application. The student must submit the application to the service center having jurisdiction over the school the student is currently authorized to attend, at least 15 days but not more than 60 days before the program end date on the student's Form I-20. The application must also be accompanied by the student's Form I-20 and the Forms I-94 of the student's spouse and children, if applicable.</p><p>(iii) <em>Period of stay.</em> If an application for extension is granted, the student and the student's spouse and children, if applicable, are to be given an extension of stay for the period of time necessary to complete the course of study, plus 30 days within which to depart from the United States, or for a total period of one year, whichever is less. A student's M-2 spouse and children are not eligible for an extension unless the M-1 student is granted an extension of stay, or for a longer period than is granted to the M-1 student.</p><p>(iv) <em>SEVIS update.</em> A DSO must update SEVIS to recommend that a student be approved for an extension of stay. The SEVIS Form I-20 must be printed with the recommendation and new program end date for submission by mail to the service center, with Form I-539, and Forms I-94 if applicable.</p><p>(11) <em>School transfer</em>&mdash;(i) <em>Eligibility.</em> An M-1 student may not transfer to another school after six months from the date the student is first admitted as, or changes nonimmigrant classification to that of, an M-1 student unless the student is unable to remain at the school to which the student was initially admitted due to circumstances beyond the student's control. An M-1 student may be otherwise eligible to transfer to another school if the student&mdash;</p><p>(A) Is a bona fide nonimmigrant;</p><p>(B) Has been pursuing a full course of study at the school the student was last authorized to attend;</p><p>(C) Intends to pursue a full course of study at the school to which the student intends to transfer; and</p><p>(D) Is financially able to attend the school to which the student intends to transfer.            </p><p>(ii) <em>Procedure.</em> A student must apply to the Service on Form I-539 for permission to transfer between schools. Upon application for school transfer, a student may effect the transfer subject to approval of the application. A student who transfers without complying with this requirement or whose application is denied after transfer pursuant to this regulation is considered to be out of status. If the application is approved, the approval of the transfer will be determined to be the program start date listed on the Form I-20, and the student will be granted an extension of stay for the period of time necessary to complete the new course of study plus 30 days, or for a total period of one year, whichever is less.</p><p>(A) <em>Non-SEVIS school.</em> The application must be accompanied by the Form I-20ID copy and the Form I-94 of the student's spouse and children, if applicable. The Form I-539 must also be accompanied by Form I-20M-N properly and completely filled out by the student and by the designated official of the school which the student wishes to attend. The student must submit the application for school transfer to the service center having jurisdiction over the school the student is currently authorized to attend. Upon approval, the adjudicating officer will endorse the name of the school to which the transfer is authorized on the student's Form I-20ID copy and return it to the student. The officer will also endorse Form I-20M-N to indicate that a school transfer has been authorized and forward it to the Service's processing center for updating. The processing center will forward Form I-20M-N to the school to which the transfer has been authorized to notify the school of the action taken.</p><p>(B) <em>SEVIS school.</em> The student must first notify his or her current school of the intent to transfer and indicate the school to which the student intends to transfer. Upon notification by the student, the current school must update SEVIS to show the student as a &ldquo;transfer out&rdquo; and input the &ldquo;release date&rdquo; for transfer. Once updated as a &ldquo;transfer out&rdquo; the transfer school is permitted to generate a SEVIS Form I-20 for transfer but will not gain access to the student's SEVIS record until the release date is reached. Upon receipt of the SEVIS Form I-20 from the transfer school, the student must submit Form I-539 in accordance with &sect; 214.2(m)(11) to the service center with jurisdiction over the current school. The student may enroll in the transfer school at the next available term or session and is required to notify the DSO of the transfer school immediately upon beginning attendance. The transfer school must update the student's registration record in SEVIS in accordance with &sect; 214.3(g)(3). Upon approval of the transfer application, the Service officer will endorse the name of the school to which the transfer is authorized on the student's SEVIS Form I-20 and return it to the student.</p><p>(C) <em>Transition process.</em> Once SEVIS is fully operational and interfaced with the service center benefit processing system, the Service officer will transmit the approval of the transfer to SEVIS and endorse the name of the school to which transfer is authorized on the student's SEVIS Form I-20 and return it to the student. As part of a transitional process until that time, the student is required to notify the DSO at the transfer school of the decision of the Service within 15 days of the receipt of the adjudication by the Service. Upon notification by the student of the approval of the Service, the DSO must immediately update SEVIS to show that approval of the transfer has been granted. The DSO must then print an updated SEVIS Form I-20 for the student indicating that the transfer has been completed. If the application for transfer is denied, the student is out of status and the DSO must terminate the student's record in SEVIS.</p><p>(iii) <em>Student who has not been pursuing a full course of study.</em> If an M-1 student who has not been pursuing a full course of study at the school the student was last authorized to attend desires to attend a different school, the student must apply for reinstatement to student status under paragraph (m)(16) of this section.</p><p>(12) <em>Change in educational objective.</em> An M-1 student may not change educational objective.</p><p>(13) <em>Employment.</em> Except as provided in paragraph (m)(14) of this section, a student may not accept employment.            </p><p>(14) <em>Practical training</em>&mdash;(i) <em>When practical training may be authorized.</em> Temporary employment for practical training may be authorized only after completion of the student's course of study.</p><p>(A) The proposed employment is recommended for the purpose of practical training;</p><p>(B) The proposed employment is related to the student's course of study; and</p><p>(C) Upon the designated school official's information and belief, employment comparable to the proposed employment is not available to the student in the country of the student's foreign residence.</p><p>(ii) <em>Application.</em> A M-1 student must apply for permission to accept employment for practical training on Form I-765, with fee as contained in 8 CFR 103.7(b)(1), accompanied by a Form I-20 that has been endorsed for practical training by the designated school official. The application must be submitted prior to the program end date listed on the student's Form I-20 but not more than 90 days before the program end date. The designated school official must certify on Form I-538 that&mdash;</p><p>(A) The proposed employment is recommended for the purpose of practical training;</p><p>(B) The proposed employment is related to the student's course of study; and</p><p>(C) Upon the designated school official's information and belief, employment comparable to the proposed employment is not available to the student in the country of the student's foreign residence.</p><p>(iii) <em>Duration of practical training.</em> When the student is authorized to engage in employment for practical training, he or she will be issued an employment authorization document. The M-1 student may not begin employment until he or she has been issued an employment authorization document by the Service. One month of employment authorization will be granted for each four months of full-time study that the M-1 student has completed. However, an M-1 student may not engage in more than six months of practical training in the aggregate. The student will not be granted employment authorization if he or she cannot complete the requested practical training within six months.</p><p>(iv) <em>Temporary absence of M-1 student granted practical training.</em> An M-1 student who has been granted permission to accept employment for practical training and who temporarily departs from the United States, may be readmitted for the remainder of the authorized period indicated on the student's Form I-20 ID copy. The student must be returning to the United States to perform the authorized practical training. A student may not be readmitted to begin practical training which was not authorized prior to the student's departure from the United States.</p><p>(v) <em>Effect of strike or other labor dispute.</em> Authorization for all employment for practical training is automatically suspended upon certification by the Secretary of Labor or the Secretary's designee to the Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization or the Commissioner's designee that a strike or other labor dispute involving a work stoppage of workers is in progress in the occupation at the place of employment. As used in this paragraph, &ldquo;place of employment&rdquo; means wherever the employer or joint employer does business.</p><p>(vi) <em>SEVIS process.</em> The DSO must update the student's record in SEVIS to recommend that the Service approve the student for practical training, and print SEVIS Form I-20 with the recommendation, for the student to submit to the Service with Form I-765 as provided in this paragraph (m)(14).</p><p>(15) <em>Decision on application for extension, permission to transfer to another school, or permission to accept employment for practical training.</em> The Service shall notify the applicant of the decision and, if the application is denied, of the reason(s) for the denial. The applicant may not appeal the decision.</p><p>(16) <em>Reinstatement to student status</em>&mdash;(i) <em>General.</em> A district director may consider reinstating a student who makes a request for reinstatement on Form I-539, Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status, accompanied by a properly completed SEVIS Form I-20 indicating the DSO's recommendation for reinstatement (or a properly completed Form I-20M-N issued prior to January 30, 2003, from the school the student is attending or intends to attend prior to August 1, 2003). The district director may consider granting the request only if the student:</p><p>(A) Has not been out of status for more than 5 months at the time of filing the request for reinstatement (or demonstrates that the failure to file within the 5 month period was the result of exceptional circumstances and that the student filed the request for reinstatement as promptly as possible under these exceptional circumstances);</p><p>(B) Does not have a record of repeated or willful violations of the Service regulations;</p><p>(C) Is currently pursuing, or intends to pursue, a full course of study at the school which issued the Form I-20M-N or SEVIS Form I-20;</p><p>(D) Has not engaged in unlawful employment;</p><p>(E) Is not deportable on any ground other than section 237(a)(1)(B) or (C)(i) of the Act; and</p><p>(F) Establishes to the satisfaction of the Service, by a detailed showing, either that:</p><p>(<em>1</em>) The violation of status resulted from circumstances beyond the student's control. Such circumstances might include serious injury or illness, closure of the institution, a natural disaster, or inadvertence, oversight or neglect on the part of the DSO, but do not include instances where a pattern of repeated violations or where a willful failure on the part of the student resulted in the need for reinstatement; or</p><p>(<em>2</em>) The violation relates to a reduction in the student's course load that would have been within a DSO's power to authorize, and that failure to approve reinstatement would result in extreme hardship to the student.</p><p>(ii) <em>Decision.</em> If the Service reinstates the student, the Service shall endorse the student's copy of Form I-20 to indicate that the student has been reinstated and return the form to the student. If the Form I-20 is from a non-SEVIS school, the school copy will be forwarded to the school. If the Form I-20 is from a SEVIS school, the adjudicating officer will update SEVIS to reflect the Service's decision. In either case, if the Service does not reinstate the student, the student may not appeal the decision. The district director will send notification to the school of the decision.</p><p>(17) <em>Spouse and children of M-1 student.</em> The M-2 spouse and minor children of an M-1 student shall each be issued an individual SEVIS Form I-20 in accordance with the provisions of &sect; 214.3(k).</p><p>(i) <em>Employment.</em> The M-2 spouse and children may not accept employment.</p><p>(ii) <em>Study.</em> (A) The M-2 spouse may not engage in full time study, and the M-2 child may only engage in full time study if the study is in an elementary or secondary school (kindergarten through twelfth grade). The M-2 spouse and child may engage in study that is avocational or recreational in nature.</p><p>(B) An M-2 spouse or M-2 child desiring to engage in full time study, other than that allowed for a child in paragraph (m)(17)(ii) of this section, must apply for and obtain a change of nonimmigrant classification to F-1, J-1, or M-1 status. An M-2 spouse or child who was enrolled on a full time basis prior to January 1, 2003, will be allowed to continue study but must file for a change of nonimmigrant classification to F-1, J-1, or M-1 status on or before March 11, 2003.</p><p>(C) An M-2 spouse or M-2 child violates his or her nonimmigrant status by engaging in full time study except as provided in paragraph (m)(17)(i) and (ii) of this section.</p><p>(18) <em>Current name and address.</em> A student must inform the Service and the DSO of any legal changes to his or her name or of any change of address, within 10 days of the change, in a manner prescribed by the school. A student enrolled at a SEVIS school can satisfy the requirement in 8 CFR 265.1 of notifying the Service by providing a notice of a change of address within 10 days to the DSO, and the DSO in turn shall enter the information in SEVIS within 21 days of notification by the student. A nonimmigrant student enrolled at a non-SEVIS institution must submit a notice of change of address to the Service, as provided in 8 CFR 265.1, within 10 days of the change. Except in the case of a student who cannot receive mail where he or she resides, the address provided by the student must be the actual physical location where the student resides rather than a mailing address. In cases where a student provides a mailing address, the school must maintain a record of, and must provide upon request from the Service, the actual physical location where the student resides.</p><p>(19) <em>Special rules for certain border commuter students</em>&mdash;(i) <em>Applicability.</em> For purposes of the special rules in this paragraph (m)(19), the term &ldquo;border commuter student&rdquo; means a national of Canada or Mexico who is admitted to the United States as an M-1 student to enroll in a full course of study, albeit on a part-time basis, in an approved school located within 75 miles of a United States land border. The border commuter student must maintain actual residence and place of abode in the student's country of nationality, and seek admission to the United States at a land border port-of-entry. These special rules do not apply to a national of Canada or Mexico who is:</p><p>(A) Residing in the United States while attending an approved school as an M-1 student, or</p><p>(B) Enrolled in a full course of study as defined in paragraph (m)(9) of this section.</p><p>(ii) <em>Full course of study.</em> The border commuter student must be enrolled in a full course of study at the school that leads to the attainment of a specific educational or vocational objective, albeit on a part-time basis. A designated school official at the school may authorize an eligible border commuter student to enroll in a course load below that otherwise required for a full course of study under paragraph (m)(9) of this section, provided that the reduced course load is consistent with the border commuter student's approved course of study.</p><p>(iii) <em>Period of stay.</em> An M-1 border commuter student is not entitled to an additional 30-day period of stay otherwise available under paragraph (m)(5) of this section.</p><p>(iv) <em>Employment.</em> A border commuter student may not be authorized to accept any employment in connection with his or her M-1 student status, except for practical training as provided in paragraph (m)(14) of this section.</p><p>(20) <em>Remittance of the fee.</em> An alien who applies for M-1 or M-3 nonimmigrant status in order to enroll in a program of study at a DHS-approved vocational educational institution is required to pay the SEVIS fee to DHS, pursuant to 8 CFR 214.13, except as otherwise provided in that section.</p><p>(n) <em>Certain parents and children of section 101(a)(27)(I) special immigrants</em>&mdash;(1) <em>Parent of special immigrant.</em> Upon application, a parent of a child accorded special immigrant status under section 101(a)(27)(I)(i) of the Act may be granted status under section 101(a)(15)(N)(i) of the Act as long as the permanent resident child through whom eligibility is derived remains a child as defined in section 101(b)(1) of the Act.</p><p>(2) <em>Child of section 101(a)(27)(I) special immigrants and section 101(a)(15)(N)(i) nonimmigrants.</em> Children of parents granted nonimmigrant status under section 101(a)(15)(N)(i) of the Act, or of parents who have been granted special immigrant status under section 101(a)(27)(I) (ii), (iii) or (iv) of the Act may be granted status under section 101(a)(15)(N)(ii) of the Act for such time as each remains a child as defined in section 101(b)(1) of the Act.</p><p>(3) <em>Admission and extension of stay.</em> A nonimmigrant granted (N) status shall be admitted for not to exceed three years with extensions in increments up to but not to exceed three years. Status as an (N) nonimmigrant shall terminate on the date the child described in paragraph (n)(1) or (n)(2) of this section no longer qualifies as a child as defined in section 101(b)(1) of the Act.</p><p>(4) <em>Employment.</em> A nonimmigrant admitted in or granted (N) status is authorized employment incident to (N) status without restrictions as to location or type of employment.</p><p>(o) <em>Aliens of extraordinary ability or achievement</em>&mdash;(1) <em>Classifications</em>&mdash;(i) <em>General.</em> Under section 101(a)(15)(O) of the Act, a qualified alien may be authorized to come to the United States to perform services relating to an event or events if petitioned for by an employer. Under this nonimmigrant category, the alien may be classified under section 101(a)(15)(O)(i) of the Act as an alien who has extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics, or who has a demonstrated record of extraordinary achievement in the motion picture or television industry. Under section 101(a)(15)(O)(ii) of the Act, an alien having a residence in a foreign country which he or she has no intention of abandoning may be classified as an accompanying alien who is coming to assist in the artistic or athletic performance of an alien admitted under section 101(a)(15)(O)(i) of the Act. The spouse or child of an alien described in section 101(a)(15)(O)(i) or (ii) of the Act who is accompanying or following to join the alien is entitled to classification pursuant to section 101(a)(15)(O)(iii) of the Act. These classifications are called the O-1, O-2, and O-3 categories, respectively. The petitioner must file a petition with the Service for a determination of the alien's eligibility for O-1 or O-2 classification before the alien may apply for a visa or seek admission to the United States. This paragraph sets forth the standards and procedures applicable to these classifications.</p><p>(ii) <em>Description of classifications.</em> (A) An O-1 classification applies to:</p><p>(<em>1</em>) An individual alien who has extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics which has been demonstrated by sustained national or international acclaim and who is coming temporarily to the United States to continue work in the area of extraordinary ability; or</p><p>(<em>2</em>) An alien who has a demonstrated record of extraordinary achievement in motion picture and/or television productions and who is coming temporarily to the United States to continue work in the area of extraordinary achievement.</p><p>(B) An O-2 classification applies to an accompanying alien who is coming temporarily to the United States solely to assist in the artistic or athletic performance by an O-1. The O-2 alien must:</p><p>(<em>1</em>) Be an integral part of the actual performances or events and posses critical skills and experience with the O-1 alien that are not of a general nature and which are not possessed by others; or</p><p>(<em>2</em>) In the case of a motion picture or television production, have skills and experience with the O-1 alien which are not of a general nature and which are critical, either based on a pre-existing and longstanding working relationship or, if in connection with a specific production only, because significant production (including pre- and post-production) will take place both inside and outside the United States and the continuing participation of the alien is essential to the successful completion of the production.</p><p>(2) <em>Filing of petitions</em>&mdash;(i) <em>General.</em> Except as provided for in paragraph (o)(2)(iv)(A) of this section, a petitioner seeking to classify an alien as an O-1 or O-2 nonimmigrant shall file a petition on Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker, with the Service Center which has jurisdiction in the area where the alien will work. The petition may not be filed more than one year before the actual need for the alien's services. An O-1 or O-2 petition shall be adjudicated at the appropriate Service Center, even in emergency situations. Only one beneficiary may be included on an O-1 petition. O-2 aliens must be filed for on a separate petition from the O-1 alien. An O-1 or O-2 petition may only be filed by a United States employer, a United States agent, or a foreign employer through a United States agent. For purposes of paragraph (o) of this section, a foreign employer is any employer who is not amenable to service of process in the United States. A foreign employer may not directly petition for an O nonimmigrant alien but instead must use the services of a United States agent to file a petition for an O nonimmigrant alien. A United States agent petitioning on behalf of a foreign employer must be authorized to file the petition, and to accept services of process in the United States in proceedings under section 274A of the Act, on behalf of the foreign employer. An O alien may not petition for himself or herself.</p><p>(ii) <em>Evidence required to accompany a petition.</em> Petitions for O aliens shall be accompanied by the following:</p><p>(A) The evidence specified in the particular section for the classification;</p><p>(B) Copies of any written contracts between the petitioner and the alien beneficiary or, if there is no written contract, a summary of the terms of the oral agreement under which the alien will be employed;</p><p>(C) An explanation of the nature of the events or activities, the beginning and ending dates for the events or activities, and a copy of any itinerary for the events or activities; and</p><p>(D) A written advisory opinion(s) from the appropriate consulting entity or entities.</p><p>(iii) <em>Form of documentation.</em> The evidence submitted with an O petition shall conform to the following:</p><p>(A) Affidavits, contracts, awards, and similar documentation must reflect the nature of the alien's achievement and be executed by an officer or responsible person employed by the institution, firm, establishment, or organization where the work was performed.</p><p>(B) Affidavits written by present or former employers or recognized experts certifying to the recognition and extraordinary ability, or in the case of a motion picture or television production, the extraordinary achievement of the alien, shall specifically describe the alien's recognition and ability or achievement in factual terms and set forth the expertise of the affiant and the manner in which the affiant acquired such information.</p><p>(C) A legible photocopy of a document in support of the petition may be submitted in lieu of the original. However, the original document shall be submitted if requested by the Director.</p><p>(iv) <em>Other filing situations</em>&mdash;(A) <em>Services in more than one location.</em> A petition which requires the alien to work in more than one location must include an itinerary with the dates and locations of work and must be filed with the Service Center which has jurisdiction in the area where the petitioner is located. The address which the petitioner specifies as its location on the petition shall be where the petitioner is located for purposes of this paragraph.</p><p>(B) <em>Services for more than one employer.</em> If the beneficiary will work concurrently for more than one employer within the same time period, each employer must file a separate petition with the Service Center that has jurisdiction over the area where the alien will perform services, unless an established agent files the petition.</p><p>(C) <em>Change of employer.</em> If an O-1 or O-2 alien in the United States seeks to change employers, the new employer must file a petition and a request to extend the alien's stay with the Service Center having jurisdiction over the new place of employment. An O-2 alien may change employers only in conjunction with a change of employers by the principal O-1 alien. If the O-1 or O-2 petition was filed by an agent, an amended petition must be filed with evidence relating to the new employer and a request for an extension of stay.</p><p>(D) <em>Amended petition.</em> The petitioner shall file an amended petition on Form I-129, with fee, with the Service Center where the original petition was filed to reflect any material changes in the terms and conditions of employment or the beneficiary's eligibility as specified in the original approved petition. In the case of a petition filed for an artist or entertainer, a petitioner may add additional performances or engagements during the validity period of the petition without filing an amended petition, provided the additional performances or engagements require an alien of O-1 caliber.</p><p>(E) <em>Agents as petitioners.</em> A United States agent may file a petition in cases involving workers who are traditionally self-employed or workers who use agents to arrange short-term employment on their behalf with numerous employers, and in cases where a foreign employer authorizes the agent to act in its behalf. A United States agent may be: The actual employer of the beneficiary, the representative of both the employer and the beneficiary; or, a person or entity authorized by the employer to act for, or in place of, the employer as its agent. A petition filed by an agent is subject to the following conditions:</p><p>(<em>1</em>) An agent performing the function of an employer must provide the contractual agreement between the agent and the beneficiary which specifies the wage offered and the other terms and conditions of employment of the beneficiary.            </p><p>(<em>2</em>) A person or company in business as an agent may file the petition involving multiple employers as the representative of both the employers and the beneficiary, if the supporting documentation includes a complete itinerary of the event or events. The itinerary must specify the dates of each service or engagement, the names and addresses of the actual employers, and the names and addresses of the establishments, venues, or locations where the services will be performed. A contract between the employers and the beneficiary is required. The burden is on the agent to explain the terms and conditions of the employment and to provide any required documentation.</p><p>(<em>3</em>) A foreign employer who, through a United States agent, files a petition for an O nonimmigrant alien is responsible for complying with all of the employer sanctions provisions of section 274A of the Act and 8 CFR part 274a.</p><p>(F) <em>Multiple beneficiaries.</em> More than one O-2 accompanying alien may be included on a petition if they are assisting the same O-1 alien for the same events or performances, during the same period of time, and in the same location.</p><p>(G) <em>Traded professional O-1 athletes.</em> In the case of a professional O-1 athlete who is traded from one organization to another organization, employment authorization for the player will automatically continue for a period of 30 days after acquisition by the new organization, within which time the new organization is expected to file a new Form I-129. If a new Form I-129 is not filed within 30 days, employment authorization will cease. If a new Form I-129 is filed within 30 days, the professional athlete shall be deemed to be in valid O-1 status, and employment shall continue to be authorized, until the petition is adjudicated. If the new petition is denied, employment authorization will cease.</p><p>(3) <em>Petition for alien of extraordinary ability or achievement (O-1)</em>&mdash;(i) <em>General.</em> Extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics, or extraordinary achievement in the case of an alien in the motion picture or television industry, must be established for an individual alien. An O-1 petition must be accompanied by evidence that the work which the alien is coming to the United States to continue is in the area of extraordinary ability, and that the alien meets the criteria in paragraph (o)(3)(iii) or (iv) of this section.</p><p>(ii) <em>Definitions.</em> As used in this paragraph, the term:</p><p><em>Arts</em> includes any field of creative activity or endeavor such as, but not limited to, fine arts, visual arts, culinary arts, and performing arts. Aliens engaged in the field of arts include not only the principal creators and performers but other essential persons such as, but not limited to, directors, set designers, lighting designers, sound designers, choreographers, choreologists, conductors, orchestrators, coaches, arrangers, musical supervisors, costume designers, makeup artists, flight masters, stage technicians, and animal trainers.</p><p><em>Event</em> means an activity such as, but not limited to, a scientific project, conference, convention, lecture series, tour, exhibit, business project, academic year, or engagement. Such activity may include short vacations, promotional appearances, and stopovers which are incidental and/or related to the event. A group of related activities may also be considered to be an event.

Such aliens may not accompany O-1 aliens in the fields of science, business, or education. Although the O-2 alien must obtain his or her own classification, this classification does not entitle him or her to work separate and apart from the O-1 alien to whom he or she provides support. An O-2 alien must be petitioned for in conjunction with the services of the O-1 alien.</p><p>(ii) <em>Evidentiary criteria for qualifying as an O-2 accompanying alien</em>&mdash;(A) <em>Alien accompanying an O-1 artist or athlete of extraordinary ability.</em> To qualify as an O-2 accompanying alien, the alien must be coming to the United States to assist in the performance of the O-1 alien, be an integral part of the actual performance, and have critical skills and experience with the O-1 alien which are not of a general nature and which are not possessed by a U.S. worker.</p><p>(B) <em>Alien accompanying an O-1 alien of extraordinary achievement.</em> To qualify as an O-2 alien accompanying and O-1 alien involved in a motion picture or television production, the alien must have skills and experience with the O-1 alien which are not of a general nature and which are critical based on a pre-existing longstanding working relationship or, with respect to the specific production, because significant production (including pre- and post-production work) will take place both inside and outside the United States and the continuing participation of the alien is essential to the successful completion of the production.</p><p>(C) The evidence shall establish the current essentiality, critical skills, and experience of the O-2 alien with the O-1 alien and that the alien has substantial experience performing the critical skills and essential support services for the O-1 alien. In the case of a specific motion picture or television production, the evidence shall establish that significant production has taken place outside the United States, and will take place inside the United States, and that the continuing participation of the alien is essential to the successful completion of the production.</p><p>(5) <em>Consultation</em>&mdash;(i) <em>General.</em> (A) Consultation with an appropriate U.S. peer group (which could include a person or persons with expertise in the field), labor and/or management organization regarding the nature of the work to be done and the alien's qualifications is mandatory before a petition for an O-1 or O-2 classification can be approved.</p><p>(B) Except as provided in paragraph (o)(5)(i)(E) of this section, evidence of consultation shall be in the form of a written advisory opinion from a peer group (which could include a person or persons with expertise in the field), labor and/or management organization with expertise in the specific field involved.</p><p>(C) Except as provided in paragraph (o)(5)(i)(E) of this section, the petitioner shall obtain a written advisory opinion from a peer group (which could include a person or persons with expertise in the field), labor, and/or management organization with expertise in the specific field involved. The advisory opinion shall be submitted along with the petition when the petition is filed. If the advisory opinion is not favorable to the petitioner, the advisory opinion must set forth a specific statement of facts which supports the conclusion reached in the opinion. Advisory opinions must be submitted in writing and must be signed by an authorized official of the group or organization.</p><p>(D) Except as provided in paragraph (o)(5)(i)(E) and (G) of this section, written evidence of consultation shall be included in the record in every approved O petition. Consultations are advisory and are not binding on the Service.</p><p>(E) In a case where the alien will be employed in the field of arts, entertainment, or athletics, and the Service has determined that a petition merits expeditious handling, the Service shall contact the appropriate labor and/or management organization and request an advisory opinion if one is not submitted by the petitioner. The labor and/or management organization shall have 24 hours to respond to the Service's request. The Service shall adjudicate the petition after receipt of the response from the consulting organization. The labor and/or management organization shall then furnish the Service with a written advisory opinion within 5 days of the initiating request. If the labor and/or management organization fails to respond within 24 hours, the Service shall render a decision on the petition without the advisory opinion.</p><p>(F) In a routine processing case where the petition is accompanied by a written opinion from a peer group, but the peer group is not a labor organization, the Director will forward a copy of the petition and all supporting documentation to the national office of the appropriate labor organization within 5 days of receipt of the petition. If there is a collective bargaining representative of an employer's employees in the occupational classification for which the alien is being sought, that representative shall be the appropriate labor organization for purposes of this section. The labor organization will then have 15 days from receipt of the petition and supporting documents to submit to the Service a written advisory opinion, comment, or letter of no objection. Once the 15-day period has expired, the Director shall adjudicate the petition in no more than 14 days. The Director may shorten this time in his or her discretion for emergency reasons, if no unreasonable burden would be imposed on any participant in the process. If the labor organization does not respond within 15 days, the Director will render a decision on the record without the advisory opinion.</p><p>(G) In those cases where it is established by the petitioner that an appropriate peer group, including a labor organization, does not exist, the Service shall render a decision on the evidence of record.</p><p>(ii) <em>Consultation requirements for an O-1 alien for extraordinary ability</em>&mdash;(A) <em>Content.</em> Consultation with a peer group in the area of the alien's ability (which may include a labor organization), or a person or persons with expertise in the area of the alien's ability, is required in an O-1 petition for an alien of extraordinary ability. If the advisory opinion is not favorable to the petitioner, the advisory opinion must set forth a specific statement of facts which supports the conclusion reached in the opinion. If the advisory opinion is favorable to the petitioner, it should describe the alien's ability and achievements in the field of endeavor, describe the nature of the duties to be performed, and state whether the position requires the services of an alien of extraordinary ability. A consulting organization may also submit a letter of no objection in lieu of the above if it has no objection to the approval of the petition.</p><p>(B) <em>Waiver of consultation of certain aliens of extraordinary ability in the field of arts.</em> Consultation for an alien of extraordinary ability in the field of arts shall be waived by the Director in those instances where the alien seeks readmission to the United States to perform similar services within 2 years of the date of a previous consultation. The director shall, within 5 days of granting the waiver, forward a copy of the petition and supporting documentation to the national office of an appropriate labor organization. Petitioners desiring to avail themselves of the waiver should submit a copy of the prior consultation with the petition and advise the Director of the waiver request.</p><p>(iii) <em>Consultation requirements for an O-1 alien of extraordinary achievement.</em> In the case of an alien of extraordinary achievement who will be working on a motion picture or television production, consultation shall be made with the appropriate union representing the alien's occupational peers and a management organization in the area of the alien's ability. If an advisory opinion is not favorable to the petitioner, the advisory opinion must set forth a specific statement of facts which supports the conclusion reached in the opinion. If the advisory opinion is favorable to the petitioner, the written advisory opinion from the labor and management organizations should describe the alien's achievements in the motion picture or television field and state whether the position requires the services of an alien of extraordinary achievement. If a consulting organization has no objection to the approval of the petition, the organization may submit a letter of no objection in lieu of the above.</p><p>(iv) <em>Consultation requirements for an O-2 accompanying alien.</em> Consultation with a labor organization with expertise in the skill area involved is required for an O-2 alien accompanying an O-1 alien of extraordinary ability.

If an advisory opinion is not favorable to the petitioner, the advisory opinion must set forth a specific statement of facts which supports the conclusion reached in the opinion. If the advisory opinion is favorable to the petitioner, the opinion provided by the labor and/or management organization should describe the alien's essentiality to, and working relationship with, the O-1 artist or athlete and state whether there are available U.S. workers who can perform the support services. If the alien will accompany an O-1 alien involved in a motion picture or television production, the advisory opinion should address the alien's skills and experience wit the O-1 alien and whether the alien has a pre-existing longstanding working relationship with the O-1 alien, or whether significant production will take place in the United States and abroad and if the continuing participation of the alien is essential to the successful completion of the production. A consulting organization may also submit a letter of no objection in lieu of the above if it has no objection to the approval of the petition.</p><p>(v) <em>Organizations agreeing to provide advisory opinions.</em> The Service will list in its Operations Instructions for O classification those peer groups, labor organizations, and/or management organizations which have agreed to provide advisory opinions to the Service and/or petitioners. The list will not be an exclusive or exhaustive list. The Service and petitioners may use other sources, such as publications, to identify appropriate peer groups, labor organizations, and management organizations. Additionally, the Service will list in its Operations Instructions those occupations or fields of endeavor where the nonexistence of an appropriate consulting entity has been verified.</p><p>(6) <em>Approval and validity of petition</em>&mdash;(1) <em>Approval.</em> The Director shall consider all of the evidence submitted and such other evidence as may be independently required to assist in the adjudication.

The petitioner must also request a petition extension. The dates of extension shall be the same for the petition and the beneficiary's extension of stay. The alien beneficiary must be physically present in the United States at the time of filing of the extension of stay. Even though the request to extend the petition and the alien's stay are combined on the petition, the Director shall make a separate determination on each. If the alien leaves the United States for business or personal reasons while the extension requests are pending, the petitioner may request the Director to cable notification of approval of the petition extension to the consular office abroad where the alien will apply for a visa.</p><p>(ii) <em>Extension period.</em> An extension of stay may be authorized in increments of up to 1 year for an O-1 or O-2 beneficiary to continue or complete the same event or activity for which he or she was admitted plus an additional 10 days to allow the beneficiary to get his or her personal affairs in order.</p><p>(iii) <em>Denial of an extension of stay.</em> The denial of the request for the alien's extension of temporary stay may not be appealed.</p><p>(13) <em>Effect of approval of a permanent labor certification or filing of a preference petition on O classification.</em> The approval of a permanent labor certification or the filing of a preference petition for an alien shall not be a basis for denying an O-1 petition, a request to extend such a petition, or the alien's application for admission, change of status, or extension of stay. The alien may legitimately come to the United States for a temporary period as an O-1 nonimmigrant and depart voluntarily at the end of his or her authorized stay and, at the same time, lawfully seek to become a permanent resident of the United States.</p><p>(14) <em>Effect of a strike.</em> (i) If the Secretary of Labor certifies to the Commissioner that a strike or other labor dispute involving a work stoppage of workers is in progress in the occupation at the place where the beneficiary is to be employed, and that the employment of the beneficiary would adversely affect the wages and working conditions of U.S. citizens and lawful resident workers:</p><p>(A) A petition to classify an alien as a nonimmigrant as defined in section 101(a)(15)(O) of the Act shall be denied; or</p><p>(B) If a petition has been approved, but the alien has not yet entered the United States, or has entered the United States but has not commenced employment, the approval of the petition is automatically suspended, and the application for admission on the basis of the petition shall be denied.</p><p>(ii) If there is a strike or other labor dispute involving a work stoppage of workers in progress, but such strike or other labor dispute is not certified under paragraph (o)(14)(i) of this section, the Commissioner shall not deny a petition or suspend an approved petition.</p><p>(iii) If the alien has already commenced employment in the United States under an approved petition and is participating in a strike or labor dispute involving a work stoppage of workers, whether or not such strike or other labor dispute has been certified by the Secretary of Labor, the alien shall not be deemed to be failing to maintain his or her status solely on account of past, present, or future participation in a strike or other labor dispute involving a work stoppage of workers but is subject to the following terms and conditions:</p><p>(A) The alien shall remain subject to all applicable provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act and regulations promulgated thereunder in the same manner as are all other O nonimmigrants;</p><p>(B) The status and authorized period of stay of such an alien is not modified or extended in any way by virtue of his or her participation in a strike or other labor dispute involving a work stoppage of workers; and</p><p>(C) Although participation by an O nonimmigrant alien in a strike or other labor dispute involving a work stoppage of workers will not constitute a ground for deportation, and alien who violates his or her status or who remains in the United States after his or her authorized period of stay has expired will be subject to deportation.</p><p>(15) <em>Use of approval notice, Form I-797.</em> The Service shall notify the petitioner of Form I-797 whenever a visa petition or an extension of a visa petition is approved under the O classification. The beneficiary of an O petition who does not require a nonimmigrant visa may present a copy of the approval notice at a Port-of-Entry to facilitate entry into the United States. A beneficiary who is required to present a visa for admission, and who visa will have expired before the date of his or her intended return, may use Form I-797 to apply for a new or revalidated visa during the validity period of the petition.

Under the nonimmigrant category, the alien may be classified under section 101(a)(15)(P)(i) of the Act as an alien who is coming to the United States to perform services as an internationally recognized athlete, individually or as part of a group or team, or member of an internationally recognized entertainment group; under section 101(a)(15)(P)(ii) of the Act, who is coming to perform as an artist or entertainer under a reciprocal exchange program; under section 101(a)(15)(P)(iii) of the Act, as an alien who is coming solely to perform, teach, or coach under a program that is culturally unique; or under section 101(a)(15)(P)(iv) of the Act, as the spouse or child of an alien described in section 101(a)(15)(P) (i), (ii), or (iii) of the Act who is accompanying or following to join the alien. These classifications are called P-1, P-2, P-3, and P-4 respectively. The employer or sponsor must file a petition with the Service for review of the services to be performed and for determination of the alien's eligibility for P-1, P-2, or P-3 classification before the alien may apply for a visa or seek admission to the United States. This paragraph sets forth the standards and procedures applicable to these classifications.</p><p>(ii) <em>Description of classification</em>.(A) A P-1 classification applies to an alien who is coming temporarily to the United States:</p><p>(<em>1</em>) To perform at specific athletic competition as an athlete, individually or as part of a group or team, at an internationally recognized level or performance, or</p><p>(<em>2</em>) To perform with, or as an integral and essential part of the performance of, and entertainment group that has been recognized internationally as being outstanding in the discipline for a sustained and substantial period of time, and who has had a sustained and substantial relationship with the group (ordinarily for at least 1 year) and provides functions integral to the performance of the group.</p><p>(B) A P-2 classification applies to an alien who is coming temporarily to the United States to perform as an artist or entertainer, individually or as part of a group, or to perform as an integral part of the performance of such a group, and who seeks to perform under a reciprocal exchange program which is between an organization or organizations in the United States and an organization or organizations in one or more foreign states, and which provides for the temporary exchange of artists and entertainers, or groups of artists and entertainers.</p><p>(C) A P-3 classification applies to an alien artist or entertainer who is coming temporarily to the United States, either individually or as part of a group, or as an integral part of the performance of the group, to perform, teach, or coach under a commercial or noncommercial program that is culturally unique.</p><p>(2) <em>Filing of petitions</em>&mdash;(i) <em>General.</em> A P-1 petition for an athlete or entertainment group shall be filed by a United States employer, a United States sponsoring organization, a United States agent, or a foreign employer through a United States agent. For purposes of paragraph (p) of this section, a foreign employer is any employer who is not amenable to service of process in the United States. Foreign employers seeking to employ a P-1 alien may not directly petition for the alien but must use a United States agent. A United States agent petitioning on behalf of a foreign employer must be authorized to file the petition, and to accept service of process in the United States in proceedings under section 274A of the Act, on behalf of the foreign employer. A P-2 petition for an artist or entertainer in a reciprocal exchange program shall be filed by the United States labor organization which negotiated the reciprocal exchange agreement, the sponsoring organization, or a United States employer. A P-3 petition for an artist or entertainer in a culturally unique program shall be filed by the sponsoring organization or a United States employer.

Dependents of a NATO-1, NATO-2, NATO-3, NATO-4, NATO-5, or NATO-6 principal alien assigned to official duty in the United States may be authorized to accept, or continue in, employment based upon informal de facto arrangements upon favorable recommendation by SACLANT, pursuant to paragraph (s)(5) of this section, and issuance of employment authorization by the Service in accordance with 8 CFR part 274a.

Employment contrary to the interest of the United States includes, but is not limited to, the employment of NATO-1, NATO-2, NATO-3, NATO-4, NATO-5, or NATO-6 dependents who have criminal records; who have violated United States immigration laws or regulations, or visa laws or regulations; who have worked illegally in the United States; or who cannot establish that they have paid taxes and social security on income from current or previous United States employment.</p><p>(iii) State's FLO shall inform the Service, by contacting Headquarters, Adjudications, Attention: Chief, Business and Trade Services Branch, 425 I Street, NW., Washington, DC 20536, of any additions or changes to the formal bilateral employment agreements and informal de facto reciprocal arrangements.            </p><p>(4) <em>Applicability of a formal bilateral agreement or an informal de facto arrangement for NATO-1, NATO-2, NATO-3, NATO-4, NATO-5, or NATO-6 dependents.</em> The applicability of a formal bilateral agreement shall be based on the NATO Member State which employs the principal alien and not on the nationality of the principal alien or dependent. The applicability of an informal de facto arrangement shall be based on the NATO Member State which employs the principal alien, and the principal alien also must be a national of the NATO Member State which employs him or her in the United States. Dependents of SACLANT employees receive bilateral agreement or de facto arrangement employment privileges as appropriate based upon the nationality of the SACLANT employee (principal alien).</p><p>(5) <em>Application procedures.</em> The following procedures are required for dependent employment applications under bilateral agreements and de facto arrangements:</p><p>(i) The dependent of a NATO alien shall submit a complete application for employment authorization, including Form I-765 and Form I-566, completed in accordance with the instructions on, or attached to, those forms.

A nonimmigrant in such derivative S-7 classification shall be subject to the same period of admission, limitations, and restrictions as the alien witness or informant and must be identified by the requesting LEA on the application Form I-854 in order to qualify for S nonimmigrant classification. Family members not identified on the Form I-854 application will not be eligible for S nonimmigrant classification.</p><p>(4) <em>Request for S nonimmigrant classification.</em> An application on Form I-854, requesting S nonimmigrant classification for a witness or informant, may only be filed by a federal or state LEA (which shall include a federal or state court or a United States Attorney's Office) directly in need of the information to be provided by the alien witness or informant.

The LEA shall review Form I-854 for accuracy and ensure the alien understands the certifications made on Form I-854.</p><p>(D) <em>Filing procedure.</em> Upon completion of Form I-854, the LEA shall forward the form and all required attachments to the Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, United States Department of Justice, at the address listed on the form.</p><p>(ii) <em>Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division review</em>&mdash;(A) <em>Review of information.</em> Upon receipt of a complete application for S nonimmigrant classification on Form I-854, with all required attachments, the Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, shall ensure that all information relating to the basis of the application, the need for the witness or informant, and grounds of excludability under section 212 of the Act has been provided to the Service on Form I-854, and shall consider the negative and favorable factors warranting an exercise of discretion on the alien's behalf. No application may be acted on by the Assistant Attorney General unless the eligible LEA making the request has proceeded in accordance with the instructions on, or attached to, Form I-854 and agreed to all provisions therein.</p><p>(B) <em>Advisory panel.</em> Where necessary according to procedures established by the Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, an advisory panel, composed of representatives of the Service, Marshals Service, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Drug Enforcement Administration, Criminal Division, and the Department of State, and those representatives of other LEAs, including state and federal courts designated by the Attorney General, will review the completed application and submit a recommendation to the Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, regarding requests for S nonimmigrant classification.

A petition that requires services to be performed or training to be received in more than one location must include an itinerary with the dates and locations of the services or training and must be filed with USCIS as provided in the form instructions. The address that the petitioner specifies as its location on the Form I-129 shall be where the petitioner is located for purposes of this paragraph.</p><p>(C) <em>Services or training for more than one employer.</em> If the beneficiary will perform nonagricultural services for, or receive training from, more than one employer, each employer must file a separate petition with USCIS as provided in the form instructions.</p><p>(D) <em>Change of employers.</em> If the alien is in the United States and seeks to change employers, the prospective new employer must file a petition on Form I-129 requesting classification and an extension of the alien's stay in the United States. If the new petition is approved, the extension of stay may be granted for the validity of the approved petition. The validity of the petition and the alien's extension of stay must conform to the limits on the alien's temporary stay that are prescribed in paragraph (h)(13) of this section. Except as provided by 8 CFR 274a.12(b)(21) or section 214(n) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1184(n), the alien is not authorized to begin the employment with the new petitioner until the petition is approved. An H-1C nonimmigrant alien may not change employers.</p><p>(iii) <em>Naming beneficiaries.</em> H-1B, H-1C, and H-3 petitions must include the name of each beneficiary. All H-2A and H-2B petitions must include the name of each beneficiary who is currently in the United States, but not the name of those beneficiaries who are not currently in the United States. However, a petitioner filing an H-2B petition on behalf of workers who are not present in the United States that is supported by a temporary labor certification requiring education, training, experience, or special requirements of the beneficiary, must name all the requested workers in the petition. Unnamed beneficiaries must be shown on the petition by total number. If all of the beneficiaries covered by an H-2A or H-2B temporary labor certification have not been identified at the time a petition is filed, multiple petitions for subsequent beneficiaries may be filed at different times but must include a copy of the same temporary labor certification. Each petition must reference all previously filed petitions for that temporary labor certification. All H-2A petitions on behalf of workers who are not from a country that has been designated as a participating country in accordance with paragraph (h)(5)(i)(F)(1) of this section must individually name all the workers in the petition who fall within this category. All H-2A petitions must state the nationality of all beneficiaries, whether or not named, even if there are beneficiaries from more than one country. H-2A petitions for workers from designated participating countries and non-designated countries should be filed separately.</p><p>(5) * * *</p><p>(i) * * *                  </p><p>(A) <em>General.</em> An H-2A petition must be filed on Form I-129 with a single valid temporary agricultural labor certification. The petition may be filed by either the employer listed on the temporary labor certification, the employer's agent, or the association of United States agricultural producers named as a joint employer on the temporary labor certification.</p><p>(B) <em>Multiple beneficiaries</em>. The total number of beneficiaries of a petition or series of petitions based on the same temporary labor certification may not exceed the number of workers indicated on that document. A single petition can include more than one beneficiary if the total number does not exceed the number of positions indicated on the relating temporary labor certification.</p><p>(C) [Reserved]</p><p>(F) <em>Eligible Countries</em>. (<em>1</em>)(<em>i</em>) H-2A petitions may only be approved for nationals of countries that the Secretary of Homeland Security has designated as participating countries, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State, in a notice published in the <em>Federal Register,</em> taking into account factors, including but not limited to:</p><p>(<em>A</em>) The country's cooperation with respect to issuance of travel documents for citizens, subjects, nationals and residents of that country who are subject to a final order of removal;</p><p>(<em>B</em>) The number of final and unexecuted orders of removal against citizens, subjects, nationals and residents of that country;</p><p>(<em>C</em>) The number of orders of removal executed against citizens, subjects, nationals and residents of that country; and</p><p>(<em>D</em>) Such other factors as may serve the U.S. interest.</p><p>(<em>ii</em>) A national from a country not on the list described in paragraph (h)(5)(i)(F)(<em>1</em>)(<em>i</em>) of this section may be a beneficiary of an approved H-2A petition upon the request of a petitioner or potential H-2A petitioner, if the Secretary of Homeland Security, in his sole and unreviewable discretion, determines that it is in the U.S. interest for that alien to be a beneficiary of such petition. Determination of such a U.S. interest will take into account factors, including but not limited to:</p><p>(<em>A</em>) Evidence from the petitioner demonstrating that a worker with the required skills is not available either from among U.S. workers or from among foreign workers from a country currently on the list described in paragraph (h)(5)(i)(F)(<em>1</em>)(<em>i</em>) of this section;</p><p>(<em>B</em>) Evidence that the beneficiary has been admitted to the United States previously in H-2A status;</p><p>(<em>C</em>) The potential for abuse, fraud, or other harm to the integrity of the H-2A visa program through the potential admission of a beneficiary from a country not currently on the list; and</p><p>(<em>D</em>) Such other factors as may serve the U.S. interest.</p><p>(<em>2</em>) Once published, any designation of participating countries pursuant to paragraph (h)(5)(i)(F)(<em>1</em>)(<em>i</em>) of this section shall be effective for one year after the date of publication in the <em>Federal Register</em> and shall be without effect at the end of that one-year period.</p><p>(v) * * *</p><p>(B) <em>Evidence of employment/job training.</em> For petitions with named beneficiaries, a petition must be filed with evidence that the beneficiary met the certification's minimum employment and job training requirements, if any are prescribed, as of the date of the filing of the labor certification application. For petitions with unnamed beneficiaries, such evidence must be submitted at the time of a visa application or, if a visa is not required, at the time the applicant seeks admission to the United States. Evidence must be in the form of the past employer or employers' detailed statement(s) or actual employment documents, such as company payroll or tax records. Alternately, a petitioner must show that such evidence cannot be obtained, and submit affidavits from persons who worked with the beneficiary that demonstrate the claimed employment or job training.</p><p>(C) <em>Evidence of education and other training.</em> For petitions with named beneficiaries, a petition must be filed with evidence that the beneficiary met all of the certification's post-secondary education and other formal training requirements, if any are prescribed in the labor certification application as of date of the filing of the labor certification application. For petitions with unnamed beneficiaries, such evidence must be submitted at the time of a visa application or, if a visa is not required, at the time the applicant seeks admission to the United States. Evidence must be in the form of documents, issued by the relevant institution(s) or organization(s), that show periods of attendance, majors and degrees or certificates accorded.</p><p>(vi) <em>Petitioner consent and notification requirements</em>&mdash;(A) <em>Consent</em>. In filing an H-2A petition, a petitioner and each employer consents to allow access to the site by DHS officers where the labor is being performed for the purpose of determining compliance with H-2A requirements.</p><p>(B) <em>Agreements</em>. The petitioner agrees to the following requirements:                  </p><p>(<em>1</em>) To notify DHS, within 2 workdays, and beginning on a date and in a manner specified in a notice published in the <em>Federal Register</em> if:</p><p>(<em>i</em>) An H-2A worker fails to report to work within 5 workdays of the employment start date on the H-2A petition or within 5 workdays of the start date established by his or her employer, whichever is later;</p><p>(<em>ii</em>) The agricultural labor or services for which H-2A workers were hired is completed more than 30 days earlier than the employment end date stated on the H-2A petition; or</p><p>(<em>iii</em>) The H-2A worker absconds from the worksite or is terminated prior to the completion of agricultural labor or services for which he or she was hired.</p><p>(<em>2</em>) To retain evidence of such notification and make it available for inspection by DHS officers for a 1-year period beginning on the date of the notification. To retain evidence of a different employment start date if it is changed from that on the petition by the employer and make it available for inspection by DHS officers for the 1-year period beginning on the newly-established employment start date.</p><p>(<em>3)</em> To pay $10 in liquidated damages for each instance where the employer cannot demonstrate that it has complied with the notification requirements, unless, in the case of an untimely notification, the employer demonstrates with such notification that good cause existed for the untimely notification, and DHS, in its discretion, waives the liquidated damages amount.</p><p>(C) <em>Process</em>. If DHS has determined that the petitioner has violated the notification requirements in paragraph (h)(5)(vi)(B)(1) of this section and has not received the required notification, the petitioner will be given written notice and 30 days to reply before being given written notice of the assessment of liquidated damages.</p><p>(D) <em>Failure to pay liquidated damages</em>. If liquidated damages are not paid within 10 days of assessment, an H-2A petition may not be processed for that petitioner or any joint employer shown on the petition until such damages are paid.</p><p>(E) <em>Abscondment</em>. An H-2A worker has absconded if he or she has not reported for work for a period of 5 consecutive workdays without the consent of the employer.</p><p>(viii) * * *</p><p>(A) <em>Effect of violations of status</em>. An alien may not be accorded H-2A status who, at any time during the past 5 years, USCIS finds to have violated, other than through no fault of his or her own (e.g., due to an employer's illegal or inappropriate conduct), any of the terms or conditions of admission into the United States as an H-2A nonimmigrant, including remaining beyond the specific period of authorized stay or engaging in unauthorized employment.</p><p>(B) <em>Period of admission</em>. An alien admissible as an H-2A nonimmigrant shall be admitted for the period of the approved petition. Such alien will be admitted for an additional period of up to one week before the beginning of the approved period for the purpose of travel to the worksite, and a 30-day period following the expiration of the H-2A petition for the purpose of departure or to seek an extension based on a subsequent offer of employment. Unless authorized under 8 CFR 274a.12 or section 214(n) of the Act, the beneficiary may not work except during the validity period of the petition.</p><p>(C) <em>Limits on an individual's stay.</em> Except as provided in paragraph (h)(5)(viii)(B) of this section, an alien's stay as an H-2A nonimmigrant is limited by the term of an approved petition. An alien may remain longer to engage in other qualifying temporary agricultural employment by obtaining an extension of stay. However, an individual who has held H-2A status for a total of 3 years may not again be granted H-2A status until such time as he or she remains outside the United States for an uninterrupted period of 3 months. An absence from the United States can interrupt the accrual of time spent as an H-2A nonimmigrant against the 3-year limit. If the accumulated stay is 18 months or less, an absence is interruptive if it lasts for at least 45 days. If the accumulated stay is greater than 18 months, an absence is interruptive if it lasts for at least 2 months. Eligibility under paragraph (h)(5)(viii)(C) of this section will be determined in admission, change of status or extension proceedings. An alien found eligible for a shorter period of H-2A status than that indicated by the petition due to the application of this paragraph (h)(5)(viii)(C) of this section shall only be admitted for that abbreviated period.</p><p>(ix) <em>Substitution of beneficiaries after admission.</em> An H-2A petition may be filed to replace H-2A workers whose employment was terminated earlier than the end date stated on the H-2A petition and before the completion of work; who fail to report to work within five days of the employment start date on the H-2A petition or within five days of the start date established by his or her employer, whichever is later; or who abscond from the worksite. The petition must be filed with a copy of the certification document, a copy of the approval notice covering the workers for which replacements are sought, and other evidence required by paragraph (h)(5)(i)(D) of this section. It must also be filed with a statement giving each terminated or absconded worker's name, date and country of birth, termination date, and the reason for termination, and the date that USCIS was notified that the alien was terminated or absconded, if applicable. A petition for a replacement will not be approved where the requirements of paragraph (h)(5)(vi) of this section have not been met. A petition for replacements does not constitute the notification required by paragraph (h)(5)(vi)(B)(<em>1</em>) of this section.</p><p>(x) <em>Extensions in emergent circumstances</em>. In emergent circumstances, as determined by USCIS, a single H-2A petition may be extended for a period not to exceed 2 weeks without an additional approved labor certification if filed on behalf of one or more beneficiaries who will continue to be employed by the same employer that previously obtained an approved petition on the beneficiary's behalf, so long as the employee continues to perform the same duties and will be employed for no longer than 2 weeks after the expiration of previously-approved H-2A petition. The previously approved H-2A petition must have been based on an approved temporary labor certification, which shall be considered to be extended upon the approval of the extension of H-2A status.</p><p>(xi) <em>Treatment of petitions and alien beneficiaries upon a determination that fees were collected from alien beneficiaries.</em> (A) <em>Denial or revocation of petition</em>. As a condition to approval of an H-2A petition, no job placement fee or other compensation (either direct or indirect) may be collected at any time, including before or after the filing or approval of the petition, from a beneficiary of an H-2A petition by a petitioner, agent, facilitator, recruiter, or similar employment service as a condition of H-2A employment (other than the lesser of the fair market value or actual costs of transportation and any government-mandated passport, visa, or inspection fees, to the extent that the payment of such costs and fees by the beneficiary is not prohibited by statute or Department of Labor regulations, unless the employer agent, facilitator, recruiter, or employment service has agreed with the alien to pay such costs and fees).</p><p>(<em>1</em>) If USCIS determines that the petitioner has collected, or entered into an agreement to collect, such prohibited fee or compensation, the H-2A petition will be denied or revoked on notice unless the petitioner demonstrates that, prior to the filing of the petition, the petitioner has reimbursed the alien in full for such fees or compensation, or, where such fee or compensation has not yet been paid by the alien worker, that the agreement has been terminated.</p><p>(<em>2</em>) If USCIS determines that the petitioner knew or should have known at the time of filing the petition that the beneficiary has paid or agreed to pay any facilitator, recruiter, or similar employment service such fees or compensation as a condition of obtaining the H-2A employment, the H-2A petition will be denied or revoked on notice unless the petitioner demonstrates that, prior to the filing of the petition, the petitioner or the facilitator, recruiter, or similar employment service has reimbursed the alien in full for such fees or compensation or, where such fee or compensation has not yet been paid by the alien worker, that the agreement has been terminated.</p><p>(<em>3</em>) If USCIS determines that the beneficiary paid the petitioner such fees or compensation as a condition of obtaining the H-2A employment after the filing of the H-2A petition, the petition will be denied or revoked on notice.</p><p>(<em>4</em>) If USCIS determines that the beneficiary paid or agreed to pay the agent, facilitator, recruiter, or similar employment service such fees or compensation as a condition of obtaining the H-2A employment after the filing of the H-2A petition and with the knowledge of the petitioner, the petition will be denied or revoked unless the petitioner demonstrates that the petitioner or facilitator, recruiter, or similar employment service has reimbursed the beneficiary in full or where such fee or compensation has not yet been paid by the alien worker, that the agreement has been terminated, or notifies DHS within 2 workdays of obtaining knowledge in a manner specified in a notice published in the <em>Federal Register</em>.</p><p>(B) <em>Effect of petition revocation</em>. Upon revocation of an employer's H-2A petition based upon paragraph (h)(5)(xi)(A) of this section, the alien beneficiary's stay will be authorized and the alien will not accrue any period of unlawful presence under section 212(a)(9) of the Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(9)) for a 30-day period following the date of the revocation for the purpose of departure or extension of stay based upon a subsequent offer of employment.</p><p>(C) <em>Reimbursement as condition to approval of future H-2A petitions.</em> (<em>1</em>) <em>Filing subsequent H-2A petitions within 1 year of denial or revocation of previous H-2A petition.</em> A petitioner filing an H-2A petition within 1 year after the decision denying or revoking on notice an H-2A petition filed by the same petitioner on the basis of paragraph (h)(5)(xi)(A) of this section must demonstrate to the satisfaction of USCIS, as a condition of approval of such petition, that the petitioner or agent, facilitator, recruiter, or similar employment service has reimbursed the beneficiary in full or that the petitioner has failed to locate the beneficiary. If the petitioner demonstrates to the satisfaction of USCIS that the beneficiary was reimbursed in full, such condition of approval shall be satisfied with respect to any subsequently filed H-2A petitions, except as provided in paragraph (h)(5)(xi)(C)(<em>2</em>). If the petitioner demonstrates to the satisfaction of USCIS that it has made reasonable efforts to locate the beneficiary with respect to each H-2A petition filed within 1 year after the decision denying or revoking the previous H-2A petition on the basis of paragraph (h)(5)(xi)(A) of this section but has failed to do so, such condition of approval shall be deemed satisfied with respect to any H-2A petition filed 1 year or more after the denial or revocation. Such reasonable efforts shall include contacting any of the beneficiary's known addresses.</p><p>(<em>2</em>) <em>Effect of subsequent denied or revoked petitions</em>. An H-2A petition filed by the same petitioner subsequent to a denial under paragraph (h)(5)(xi)(A) of this section shall be subject to the condition of approval described in paragraph (h)(5)(xi)(C)(<em>1</em>) of this section, regardless of prior satisfaction of such condition of approval with respect to a previously denied or revoked petition.</p><p>(xii) <em>Treatment of alien beneficiaries upon revocation of labor certification.</em> The approval of an employer's H-2A petition is immediately and automatically revoked if the Department of Labor revokes the labor certification upon which the petition is based. Upon revocation of an H-2A petition based upon revocation of labor certification, the alien beneficiary's stay will be authorized and the alien will not accrue any period of unlawful presence under section 212(a)(9) of the Act for a 30-day period following the date of the revocation for the purpose of departure or extension of stay based upon a subsequent offer of employment.</p><p>(11) * * *</p><p>(i) * * *</p><p>(A) * * * However, H-2A petitioners must send notification to DHS pursuant to paragraph (h)(5)(vi) of this section.</p><p>(ii) <em>Immediate and automatic revocation</em>. The approval of any petition is immediately and automatically revoked if the petitioner goes out of business, files a written withdrawal of the petition, or the Department of Labor revokes the labor certification upon which the petition is based.</p>","178"
